Migrants' Rights Network,New migration measures reinforce classism and racism,11-Dec-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/12/11/new-migration-measures-classism-racism/,"Update: On 21st December 2023, the Home Office announced a change on the minimum salary requirement for British nationals bringing foreign family members to the UK, saying the threshold will first be raised to £29,000 instead of £38,700. The new Home Secretary has hit the ground running by announcing measures to bring about “the biggest ever reduction in net migration” in an attempt to cut migration by 300,000. The policies included a crackdown on dependents, raising the minimum salary required in a job offer to obtain a Skilled Worker visa and a review of the Shortage Occupation List. But what does this all mean, what will its impact be, and how are they racist and classist? Pitting workers against each other Much of the language of the Home Secretary’s speech focused on protecting British workers from migrants who will accept lower wages. This was the case for both increasing minimum salary requirements and ending the 20% lower wages for workers filling a role on the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). This pits workers against each other, obscuring the same institutions and systems that are responsible for the exploitation of them all. Giving the same justification of preventing migrants from “undercutting” domestic workers, the Home Secretary also announced that the SOL will be reviewed, in order to remove certain occupations from the list. While we agree with the scrapping of measures that allow employers to pay migrant workers 20% less than domestic workers, especially in already low-paid industries, we oppose the SOL. In fact, the Migration Advisory Committee has recommended that it be abolished. Migrants shouldn’t be restricted to certain roles. People come to the UK with a variety of skills and knowledge – why are we trying to restrict that? Alongside extortionate increases in the health surcharge, the measures amount to the creation of a two-tiered society for migrants, where only middle/upper-middle class people and above are able to migrate to this country and bring their families and survive. Even for people who do meet this threshold and don’t work in health or social care, health surcharge payments for a family can be financially debilitating – £11,000 for a family of six before the higher rate is even calculated. We don’t believe that migrants should be accepted solely on the criteria of their economic “contribution” , and, therefore, shut out if they don’t meet this. Of course migrants are essential to core industries, such as healthcare and hospitality, and without them these sectors would undoubtedly collapse. But this shouldn’t need to be said. Our pro-migrant arguments should be centred around solidarity and compassion, not around “contribution”. Breaking up families The news that people on the Health and Care Worker visa will be unable to bring dependents to the UK will break up families. Splitting up migrant families is becoming something of a trend, following the end to students being able to bring dependents with them on a Tier 4 visa, with the only exception being people on postgraduate research courses. It is unrealistic for the Government to expect the same numbers of migrants working in health and social care (a sector that has been reliant on overseas workers in recent years)  to leave their families behind, with many likely having care responsibilities. This move will increase isolation, especially in an already hostile environment for migrants. The other policy that the Government introduced that will affect families is the drastic increase in the minimum income level for family visas from £18,600 to £38,700. These policies are discriminatory. The right to a family life has become a class privilege- one that is gendered and racialised, as women and people of Colour earn less on average than White men. People of Colour in the UK are 2.5 times more likely to be in poverty compared to White people due to the systems of racism and capitalism. For women, we must consider not just the gender pay gap , but also the conditions of patriarchy that place caring responsibilities in paid and unpaid roles primarily on women. Students International students are already subjected to intrusive monitoring and strict visa conditions, which we are investigating as part of our research . It is already cruel and unfair to deny most international students the ability to bring their families with them to the UK, but these latest restrictions on their visa further limit their freedom and future in this country. It relies on the false notion that international students are using student visas as a means to get to this country under false pretences. This is a nonsensical argument considering the thousands they will have invested to come to study, and how the hostile environment and compliance monitoring of international students means they must complete their studies to remain in the UK. All this does is demonise these students, who instead require more lenience, in relation to the stresses of constant monitoring and strict limitations on their ability to switch to other visas once completing their course. With a pending review of the Graduate visa, we already know that employers do not always understand how the Graduate visa scheme functions, and that after the two years sponsorship free employment it offers, there is difficulty in transitioning to a sponsored visa system after its expiry. Therefore, it is clear that the Graduate visa does need to change, but not in a way that makes life in the UK harder for people on this route. Fundamentally, the new measures announced as part of the Government’s attack on a huge swathe of migrants here and those intending to come, will cause immense amounts of harm to communities, ignoring why people come to the UK in the first place. For many workers in low paid jobs, the UK has had a hand in creating the conditions in which they were forced to emigrate to work, whether through the legacies of past colonial exploitation, support for neoliberal economic policies that disadvantage workers, or support for repressive governments. The persistent fixation on net migration figures is a political distraction technique that has devastating consequences for migrant communities. Viewing migrants only as numbers and not as people is dehumanising, and we should be welcoming more migrants at this time. We cannot let this Government divide us and manufacture problems to blame on migrants.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Digital Hostile Environment: Passports and Facial Recognition,28-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/28/passport-facial-recognition/,"The Government has proposed using people’s passports and biometric residence permits for facial recognition. This kind of technology contributes to the increasing digitisation of the border, pushing border surveillance deeper into all of our lives. At MRN, we are concerned about the usage of travel and visa documents being used in this way, as it increases the precarious status of migratised communities in particular. We will be challenging this practice alongside our wider opposition to plans to share personal data with the police and Home Office What’s the plan? The proposal for using people’s identification documents in domestic criminal investigations comes after supermarkets reported increased numbers of thefts amidst the ongoing cost of living crisis. The policing minister, Chris Philp, revealed this at the Conservative Party conference, stating that police officers will soon be instructed to search these databases. His statement followed an announcement from the Home Office and Ministry of Defence on expanding the use of facial recognition technology. The Policing Minister has since called for police forces to double their usage of this technology by May 2024 This comes amidst the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, which could remove passports from Britain’s successor to GDPR regulations, as well as routes to effective judicial redress. It is alarming that the already lax laws governing the usage of this kind of personal data could be weakened more. It is also essential to contextualise these moves within other authoritarian legislation, such as the Public Order Act 2022, and the increasing usage of facial recognition technology. The gendered and racialised inaccuracies of the technology are worrying and reason enough to halt the expansion of facial recognition and the sources it draws from, but we fundamentally oppose it for the following reasons: The expansion of surveillance into all of our lives disproportionately affects migratised people by expanding the digital Hostile Environment. In particular, this technology advances data collection about people’s movement within London, extending the surveillance of migratised populations that already takes place through GPS ankle tagging and data sharing in public services, like the NHS, and social services. We should be stopping all data sharing of this nature, not expanding it. Check out our other work on the digital hostile environment and digitisation of the UK border.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Deprivation of citizenship is Islamophobic,20-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/20/deprivation-of-citizenship-is-islamophobic/,"A blog for Islamophobia Awareness Month 2023 Greater powers to deprive people of their British citizenship were introduced under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022. But the laws to deprive certain citizens of their citizenship has been in power a lot longer, and interestingly it is used predominantly for selected groups of people. It’s important to look at who these laws are aimed at and why. Who is being targetted? Denial or deprivation of citizenship is a core part of embedding Islamophobia in policy, particularly in Europe, South Asia and the US. This is also the case in the UK, where immigration and nationality legislation over the last twenty years has made it easier to deprive people of British citizenship. Muslims are most affected by these powers. Deprivation of citizenship is therefore a primary aspect of Islamophobia in Britain’s migration system. Racism, Islamophobia + gender The subjects of citizenship deprivation in Britain on ‘public good’ grounds have almost exclusively been Muslim and largely from a South Asian, Middle Eastern or North African background. An investigation carried out by the New Statesman discovered that 41% of People of Colour in Britain could be potentially deprived of their citizenship versus 5% of White people. Therefore, it is clear that racialised citizens and Muslims in particular are considered ‘less’ British by the State.  There is significant evidence to demonstrate the connections between racist War on Terror logics and citizenship deprivation . This racism is especially evident in cases affecting people with Bangladeshi heritage . The Immigration Act 2014 allowed the Government to deprive people of their citizenship even if they hold no other citizenship. For those from Bangladeshi heritage, the UK Government  misinterpreted Bangladeshi citizenship law, where it states that people of Bangladeshi heritage are able to claim Bangladeshi citizenship, but this must be claimed by the age of 21. In all of these cases , they were able to retain their British citizenship, because they were over 21. Shamima Begum is a prominent case here. The UK Government revoked her citizenship based on the assumption that she would not be left ‘stateless’ but would have access to  Bangladeshi citizenship. However, Bangladesh has been adamant that her claim to Bangladeshi citizenship would be refused if she attempted to claim it. Another public example of citizenship deprivation has been the case for Abu Hamza, where Egypt stripped him of his citizenship. At the same time, the British Government attempted to do the same, and attempted to deport him to Egypt. In the end, he was extradited to the USA. Citizenship deprivation is also gendered, as it is mostly men who are impacted. This reflects a decades-long construction of racialised men as emblematic of a foreign threat to the nation. These are examples of a double standard of punishment for Muslim and racialised British citizens, where the British Government dispossesses them and abdicates responsibility, but there is not the same basis for White Britons with sole British citizenship. This is exacerbated by the fact that most cases of citizenship deprivation now take place while the person is out of the country and therefore unable to re-enter Britain. As long as the practice of deprivation of citizenship continues in this manner, Muslims and People of Colour will always have second-class citizenship in Britain. Counter-terror Deprivation of citizenship and counter-terror laws are linked: most cases of deprivation on ‘public good’ grounds have been justified using counter-terror legislation. The disproportionate impact of citizenship deprivation on Muslims and People of Colour is amplified by the UK’s counter-terror measures that contribute to heightened Islamophobia. Together, citizenship deprivation and counter-terror powers intensify the idea that Muslims and migratised groups are ‘anti-British’. The definitions of offences warranting deprivation of citizenship are vague and subjective – in situations where the Home Secretary views deprivation to be conducive to the public good. This includes references to ‘terrorism’ and ‘extremism’, which have often been defined in relation to the political objectives of the British Government, such as the controversial proscription of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) and the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party). This leaves room for ‘arbitrary application and abuse’; neither ‘public good’ in nationality legislation nor ‘extremism’ are adequately defined . This is evident in the lowering of the barrier of proof for counter-terror offences, where intention is given less value than in other crimes, and where defendants bear the burden of proving innocence. This means that migration is increasingly viewed through national security terms against a backdrop of Islamophobia reinforced by the War on Terror. The figure of the migrant is imagined as Muslim, often male, and seen as a (potential) security threat. This is also internalised, extended towards citizens and residents that resemble the ‘Muslim-migrant-terrorist’ i.e. Black or Brown and especially if they are from a Muslim majority country. Muslims, regardless of migration status, experience borders in daily life through a suspicion based on the Islamophobic assumption of their proximity to terrorism , and are always at risk of their citizenship being deprived. That is why an intersectional and anti-oppression approach is essential. It means acknowledging the role Islamophobia and counter-terrorism laws play in immigration legislation and challenging the construction of migrants from Muslim-majority countries as ‘threats’ to the UK.

Migrants' Rights Network,Digitisation of the UK border: EVisas,16-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/16/evisas-digitisation-of-the-border/,"As part of the Government’s strategy to fully digitise the UK border by 2025 , the Home Office is switching from physical immigration to documents to eVisas. This accompanies the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for visitors on short-term visas. Currently, digital status only exists for people on select visas, including the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and the Hong Kong BN(O) visa, but this will be expanded to all migrants, regardless of which visa they are on, by the end of 2024. How will this affect my proof of status? Instead of sharing physical visa documents, like a Biometric Residence Card or Permit, proof of status will be shown by signing in to the ‘View and Prove’ service. This service is also accessible if someone has a Certificate of Application for a certain visa route. In order to prove right to work or rent, people will be able to generate a share code, where an employer or landlord will be able to check the individual’s name, immigration status, and any dates or conditions for their visa’s validity. This is shared through View and Prove. What else changes? People will have to upload a new photo of themselves every 5 years if under 16 and every 10 years if 16 or older. The maximum age this needs to be updated is 70 years old. People will also have to update their photo if they think their appearance has changed significantly. This is self-judged. The updated image is automatically compared against and matched with the existing photo. If the images are not automatically matched by the Home Office’s system, then a manual check may have to be performed by a Home Office caseworker. How do I switch to an eVisa? The expansion will be rolled out throughout 2024, so you do not have to take any steps right now. The Home Office will release updates on when and how to register for an UKVI account. More information on eVisas can be found here . You can also find more of our work on the Digital Hostile Environment here .",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Data-sharing and immigration enforcement,16-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/16/data-sharing-digital-hostile-environment/,"The Government is expanding data-sharing, within the Home Office, between Government departments, with private entities, like banks, and internationally. These developments are worrying, as they expand access to people’s personal and private data, bringing surveillance in our daily lives, including when accessing vital services like healthcare. Discrimination against migrants and migratised people is enshrined in data-sharing practices. Government guidance has emphasised that this is a form of legal discrimination on the basis of nationality and national or ethnic origin and implicit racial discrimination. This is in accordance with exceptions in Schedules 3 and 23 of the Equality Act 2010, which remove discrimination protections in relation to immigration law enforcement. We are particularly concerned about how data-sharing disproportionately impacts migrants and migratised people, especially those with precarious immigration status.  We are currently looking into these data-sharing agreements and how they are being implemented in order to challenge them. The financial sector The Home Office shares data with financial institutions, like banks and building societies, to prevent people with irregular status from having a bank account. The agreement with the financial sector is being restarted after it was paused in 2019 following the Windrush Scandal and the Government claims to have updated safeguards. The practice of ‘de-risking’ has also resulted in bank account closures as a result of policies around terrorism and “high-risk” countries that disproportionately affect minoritised groups. The expansion of these categories has resulted in civil servants, political figures, and activists being caught up in these practices. Third-party databases are often used in these decisions, where data collected on customers is passed onto banks. Reputational and compliance risk are overzealously applied on grounds of potential implications in terrorism and “politically-exposed persons”. These are vague and therefore subject to biases that link migratised and minoritised populations to terms like “terrorism”, for example if they were born in and send money to relatives in a country deemed to finance terrorism. This has resulted in a massive increase in account closures in recent years, which has impacted marginalised communities in particular. Data protection rules must be properly enforced under financial due diligence and compliance to prevent this. We are also concerned about the way that AI and machine learning are being integrated into this practice, further entrenching biases in decision-making and increasing wrongful closures. We are currently conducting research into how these practices are now taking place, including how they identify individuals. Home Office NHS Reference Number A tracking scheme where the NHS shared patients’ details with the Home Office was suspended in 2018 after a legal challenge from health and civil society groups, including MRN. Now, the Government has introduced new plans to assign Home Office reference numbers to migrants’ NHS files. Adding this reference number would not aid the NHS in identifying patients’ fee status, as they are already notified of who has paid the Immigration Health Surcharge, but would enable the Home Office to track migrants’ healthcare records. This comes after a previous scheme that used NHS data to track down patients allegedly breaching immigration rules was abandoned following a legal challenge pertaining to patient confidentiality, discrimination and deterring migrants from seeking care. The new plans will have the same effect: they immediately single out migratised patients, potentially deterring people from seeking treatment, as well as extending state surveillance over migratised populations’ entire lives. We have written to the Chief Executive of NHS England over this, and will continue to challenge the extension of the border into vital services like healthcare. Passports The Policing Minister recently said that he plans for passport data to be integrated into the Police National Database (PND) for facial recognition purposes in criminal investigations. For foreign nationals not on the passport database, this would be through the immigration and biometrics database. The use of these databases exacerbates the biases that already exist with facial recognition software, enabling further surveillance of racialised and migratised communities. It is important to note that Prevent data also goes on the PND, highlighting how arbitrary the criteria is to be placed on this database. This also shows the discriminatory foundations of the practice, as Prevent has been widely criticised as Islamophobic. Moves to integrate passport and visa biometrics databases into the PND are highly concerning. They expand surveillance over all of us through opaque means of mass data-sharing, harming migrants with precarious status in particular. International data-sharing There have been several developments in deals involving the sharing of data between the UK and EU. Most recently, the UK extension to the EU-US Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework came into effect in October 2023. Through this scheme, US companies can share personal data with the EU, and now the UK. The framework replaces a prior iteration, the Privacy Shield, that the European Court of Justice found contained inadequate safeguards against unlawful surveillance by US state agencies. While this replacement framework aims to fix this, the US has still failed to substantially change its surveillance laws. The UK extension to this comes amidst the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, which would allow for personal data from the UK to be shared with third countries, even when data protection for unlawful access from foreign authorities is inadequate. There are also two plans for data-sharing involving the EU for the purpose of tracking migrants’ movements through the continent using personal data: the EU Plan for International Data Sharing System and the soon to be announced EU-UK deal for Frontex to share data with UK Border Force. The former involves security-related data being shared between frontline EU forces, like Frontex, and key partner countries, strengthening internal security through new IT developments and expanding this in the future to non-member states. This includes a proposal to compare data stored under the Prüm Convention, containing national biometric, vehicle registration and police record databases, to “third country-sourced data”. The latter deal came out of the European Political Community summit in October. Frontex uses personal data from people travelling through Europe, such as from phones, to “map” migrants’ movements in real time. This deal would see this mapping data shared with the UK Border Force. Expanding data-sharing is worrying. The uses of and access to that data are often opaque, especially when private corporations are involved, and discriminatory, disproportionately affecting migratised and racialised communities and contributing to the excessive surveillance that they are subjected to. This is why we are committed to investigating how these data-sharing agreements are being implemented and raising awareness of this issue more broadly in how it affects our community.

Migrants' Rights Network,Suella’s horrendous legacy: her worst moments,13-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/13/suellas-worst-moments/,"Suella Braverman has been sacked as Home Secretary. Over the last year, she has headed up some of the most regressive immigration policies and made some inflammatory, divisive statements about marginalised groups. So, we thought we’d put together a short list of some of the most infamous moments: Her complicity in creating harmful anti-migrant laws and policies Whether it was her involvement in the ‘Illegal Migration’ Act, her proposals to deny citizenship to anyone with a criminal sentence of 12 months , or her obsession with “stopping the boats” , Suella’s commitment to demonising and violating the rights of migratised and racialised communities truly knew no bounds. When she called migrants an “invasion” and a “hurricane” Suella never shied away from scapegoating, whipping up hysteria, and fear mongering, as her “hurricane” comments showed. She had the audacity to claim migrants are an “invasion” when so many migrants are fleeing conflict and instability caused by the West’s colonial legacies and imperialism in Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. She clearly hadn’t heard of the famous quote “we are here because you were there”. Maybe now she has more time on her hands she could go educate herself. When she couldn’t stop dreaming about Rwanda We dream of a world without oppression. Suella dreams of a world where marginalised people are deported to Rwanda. Weird flex but OK. When she fangirled over the British Empire Suella has stated her “pride” for Britain’s colonial history, and that “those on the left are ashamed of our history” . We wonder how someone whose own family has fled the effects of colonialism could be so delusionally unashamed. When she attacked the Refugee Convention Appallingly yet unsurprisingly, the Home Secretary stated she wanted to abandon the 1951 Refugee Convention in favour of stricter measures to limit the eligibility for refugee protection . She believed that the Refugee Convention was not “fit for the modern age” because the threshold was too low. When in reality, the Refugee Convention is not fit for any age because the threshold is far too high. The reasons people flee are complex and numerous, including discrimination, economic instability and climate change, which are all threats to someone’s dignity and quality of life. How much harm is enough for you Suella? And if this wasn’t enough, she also went out of her way to state that people falsely claim they are gay in order to claim asylum. Let that sink in. When she took issue with migrants’ failure to “integrate” Suella expressed concern that migrants have failed to “integrate”. It’s bizarre that migrants should be expected to give up important elements of their identity in order to be respected. Instead of obsessing over how migrants can be forced to “integrate”, let’s dream of a world where migrants are celebrated and respected. When she said people chose to be unhoused She continued to prove how ridiculously out of touch she was when she tweeted that migrant rough sleepers dabble in rough sleeping as a “lifestyle choice”. No one chooses to be unhoused. Austerity policies and the UK’s racist immigration system force people to become unhoused. When she was obsessed with grooming gangs Suella made no secret of her obsession with the ethnicity of grooming gangs. She previously claimed in an interview with Sky News that grooming gang members are “almost all British-Pakistani” , despite Home Office statistics showing that group-based Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) offenders are most commonly White . This obsession also forms part of a long history of the Home Secretary’s demonisation of Muslim and racialised communities, who are often disproportionately affected by deprivation of citizenship. So called “hate marches” According to the Home Secretary, marching against ongoing settler-colonialism, genocide and ethnic cleansing is hateful ? Ok Suella. TLDR: Suella, you’re the threat And finally, who can forget when she called migrants an “existential challenge for the political and cultural institutions of the West”? She was obsessed with demonising migrants as a “threat”, drawing on the Great Replacement Theory (a White supremacist myth) in order to justify violence against them. In case it’s not abundantly clear, the actual threat to our collective society is racism and divisive rhetoric. Now as the new Home Secretary, James Cleverly, takes her place, we’re anxiously awaiting what his stance on immigration policies will be. We urge him to meet with migrants and ask them what changes they want to see. We hope his legacy won’t be following in his predecessor’s footsteps when it comes to demonising marginalised groups.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Digitisation of the UK border: Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA),13-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/13/electronic-travel-authorisation-eta/,"As part of the UK Government’s plans to fully digitise the UK border by 2025, a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system will be introduced similar to the e-visa system in the USA and Canada. By the end of 2024, people who do not need a visa to enter the UK will need to have an ETA before they visit. This will impact millions of travellers. What is an ETA? An ETA is a digital permission to travel. The ETA scheme will apply to most visitors to the UK who do not need a visa for stays of less than six months, and who do not have any other immigration status prior to travelling. An ETA will cost £10 per applicant when the scheme opens for nationals from the Gulf states and Jordan, permit multiple journeys and will be valid for two years or until the holder’s passport expires – whichever is sooner. You can find more information on the upcoming changes by checking out the Home Office’s ETA Factsheet . When will the changes come into effect? The scheme will operate for nationals from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states and Jordan first. From 25th October 2023, Qatari nationals will be the first to use the scheme followed by nationals from Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia from 1 February 2024. These nationals will move from being visa nationals to non-visa nationals. This also means the Electronic Visa Waiver (EVW) will cease to operate once moved to the ETA scheme. A worldwide expansion of the scheme will happen throughout 2024. Despite Home Office communications strategies, it is highly likely many will be caught out by the current, and future, changes to the UK border. We know that digitisation of our immigration systems can lead to more issues, so please make sure you are prepared for these pending changes. The Home Office have created a video which aims to provide a quick overview of the ETA and who will need one. Check out our other work on the Digital Hostile Environment .",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,International Day Against Fascism + Antisemitism,09-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/09/international-day-against-fascism-and-antisemitism/,"Content warning- Antisemitic violence. 9 November marks the anniversary of the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, where the Nazis brutally killed and injured Jewish people, destroyed over 8000 Jewish homes and businesses, and rounded up 30,000 Jewish men to send to concentration camps. With the rise of far-right, fascist and neo-Nazi groups across Europe, we cannot afford to be indifferent. Indifference legitimises hatred, dehumanisation and eventually, can even pave the way for genocide. This International Day Against Fascism + Antisemitism, we stand firmly against hatred in all its forms. We want to honour the legacy of Jewish-led anti-fascist groups, most notably at the Battle of Cable Street (1936) and in the post-war 43 Group. And we see their legacy in those who continue to fight against the far-right and fascists who intimidate and threaten refugees. Antisemitism, racism and other forms of oppression are on the rise in the UK, and so the struggle against fascism is as important as ever. At a time when migrants and other marginalised groups are facing a sharp increase in hate, scapegoating, hostility and violence, we must stand resolutely against indifference. At MRN, we are committed to embedding anti-oppression in our work. We recognise that all struggles are interconnected. Justice for one cannot be achieved without justice for all.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,"Silent genocides: Congo, Armenia + Sudan",07-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/07/silent-genocides/,"As the world watches in horror at the atrocities in Palestine, we must acknowledge that too little attention has been paid to the genocides unfolding in other parts of the world: in Armenia, Congo and Sudan. At MRN, we will always speak up and use our platform to raise awareness of any situation where people are being forcibly displaced. To be silent is to uphold violence. We refuse to be complicit. Congo The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer the legacies of colonialism and imperial interventions. The Congolese people have been colonised, enslaved, murdered and systematically oppressed by Belgium to extract its resources. At least 10 million people died under Belgium’s rule. Even after Congo gained independence, Western governments and corporations have continued to intervene and create instability, so they can continue to extract raw minerals and wealth, such as uranium. Belgium and the USA were complicit in the murder of Congo’s anti-colonial independence leader, Patrice Lumumba, in 1961 , after which Mobutu Sese Seko was installed as dictator. Today, Congolese civilians are being massacred by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels , as part of a long history of Western and corporate intervention in the DRC. Western corporations profit from the mining of coltan, cobalt, gold, diamond and other minerals in the DRC , whilst the West (the UK, US and France) has been providing military funding to both Rwandan and Ugandan militias in Congo . The UK has also remained silent on Rwanda’s role in the violence, which is unsurprising given the Rwanda deportation deal. Since 1996, at least 6 million Congolese have died, and millions have been displaced and are suffering, so the West can continue to benefit from Congo’s resources , and access them for cheap rates . At MRN, we call for safe routes for all those affected, and for an end to Western corporate and government interference. Armenia As suffering and gross injustices in the Global South continue to be overlooked, we condemn the genocide against the Armenian people. Armenians have been ethnically cleansed and displaced as part of a genocide by Azerbaijan, with the backing of Turkey. Over 100,000 people have been forced to leave the area after facing months of blockades. No-one should be forced to leave their homes or be displaced, but when they are, we should be offering safe routes for those that want them. We call for an end to the occupation and genocide of the Armenian people in Artsakh. Sudan Since April this year, war has raged in Sudan between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), in the aftermath of a derailed revolution by the Sudanese people. Popular protests toppled the dictatorship of Omar Al-Bashir in 2019, which was followed by a military coup by the leaders of the SAF and RSF in 2021, who were working together at the time. But now, thousands have been killed and millions forced to flee as a result of a power struggle between the RSF and SAF, while the Sudanese people face untold atrocities, violence, starvation and disease at the hands of both factions . Over 9,000 have died, whilst at least 5 million have been displaced. The RSF continues to be funded by the UAE , whilst Israel has funded both factions . This power struggle has “disproportionately affected those already suffering under a continuing genocide in Darfur” . The UK Government and the West have failed the people of Sudan. In contrast to the safe routes it provided for Ukrainians, the UK has clearly demonstrated its indifference to the suffering of people from the Global South. Safe routes should be provided regardless of nationality or ethnicity. We have a duty to assist those who are suffering and to stand in solidarity with all oppressed people.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Desensitisation to the Global Majority’s Suffering,03-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/03/desensitisation-to-global-majority-suffering/,"Media portrayals and imagery play a huge role in how we view certain groups of people. For years, so many of us have become accustomed to graphic images of suffering, war, shelling and starvation of people in the Global South. Despite the initial horror and outrage this can spark in our collective consciousness, it is only a matter of time before we become numb to these images. At MRN, we want to defy established narratives on migration and displacement. In all our campaigns, we try not to use images of people at their most vulnerable because we believe this erodes their agency and, most of the time, these photographs are taken without their consent. In 2015, the images of the death of Aylan Kurdi shocked the world and prompted outrage from media outlets, including anti-migrant publications. Across the political divide, people called for action and safe routes to avoid such a tragedy from happening again. However this compassion was short-lived and soon the divisive status quo resumed. This is trauma voyeurism. Trauma voyeurism exploits a person’s pain, suffering, body or misfortune for the purpose of viewing, sensationalism and entertainment. This is especially prevalent in the age of viral content and 24-hour news content. Humanitarian campaigns and media depictions have instilled in the West the ideas that make us associate Africa with starvation, or the Middle East with war and bombing. Ultimately, we become desensitised to their struggles and it becomes harder for us to empathise. On the other hand, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the steady stream of footage showing the exceptional, ‘unprecedented’ suffering of White Europeans grappling with things we associate with the Global South, horrified us. As a result, many states felt compelled to help and people across the West called for immediate action. As we speak, the world watches unphased as people in Palestine, Armenia, Sudan or the Congo suffer. How we relate to people matters because it has implications in policy. It is why the UK is happy to create safe routes for Ukrainians but not Sudanese people or Afghans. It is why we struggle to feel empathy for people forced into small boats or who have drowned in the Mediterranean. We need to rethink how we depict people, particularly in relation to the root causes of migration and displacement. Enacting a trauma-informed approach, tackling exploitative media practices and addressing power imbalances by actually giving people agency in how they should be depicted is essential.

Muslim voices are incredibly important to amplify, especially given the rise in Islamophobic scapegoating. At MRN, we believe in the transformative power of storytelling, especially from Muslim communities who are affected by multiple systems of oppression, such as queer Muslims, Muslim asylum seekers, Black Muslims, disabled Muslims and Muslim women.

Migrants' Rights Network,Blog: Bibby Stockholm,30-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/30/blog-bibby-stockholm/,"The thought of being moved to Bibby Stockholm is very frightening. My life stops for a moment to process the possibility of being accommodated in a three-storey vessel. As an asylum seeker, I’ve become well aware of the Home Office’s treatment, similar to the proverb of beggars, ‘beggars are not choosers’. Regrettably, I now understand what it actually means. It’s not as if I have the luxury of refusing this development; the Home Office’s stance is clear – if an asylum seeker dares to resist the relocation, they’re promptly relocated out of their current temporary accommodation. The concept of choosing where to live as an asylum seeker seems unrealistic but the Government’s approach to accommodate asylum seekers on the barge and in tents falls short of the intrinsic dignity of individuals seeking safety. The voice of asylum seekers in matters of accommodation ought to be considered and respected. After all, the journey to safety is often treacherous, and it’s disheartening to think that our voices are suppressed even when it comes to something as basic as where we lay our heads. In the same vein, the Government should be keen to receive inputs on what safe routes  should look like from those who’ve arrived in the UK through unconventional routes. Only when that happens would we witness a monumental shift towards a more empathetic approach. Those of us who have navigated unfamiliar landscapes and endured traumatic experiences undoubtedly hold valuable insights that could contribute to shaping safer routes for upcoming asylum seekers. It’s only logical that the authorities engage a meaningful dialogue with those who’ve faced the most perilous of journeys to inform the creation of pathways that truly uphold the value of human life and dignity. Yet, the reality on the ground paints a different picture. The UK Government’s approach seems to deliberately create a challenging and unwelcoming atmosphere for asylum seekers. We, who are fleeing life-threatening conditions in our homelands, encounter not just the harshness of an unfamiliar land, but also the intricate web of barriers and uncertainties that are designed to magnify our vulnerability. The issue of accommodation adds an additional layer of hardship to the already challenging journey of seeking asylum. The choice of Bibby Stockholm, a barge, as accommodation for asylum seekers despite widespread criticism, shows the shortcomings of the system. In addition to the obvious lack of basic facilities for dignified living, it contributes to the poor mental and emotional well-being among those seeking safety. Being put in such a space, cut off from a community setting, only amplifies our sense of isolation and despair. As we persist in navigating this challenging journey in pursuit of safety and security, I hold onto the aspiration that the UK government can move beyond its current stance. An asylum seeker’s story is not merely one of survival; it’s a testament to resilience, courage, and the enduring human spirit. It’s a narrative that deserves to be heard, acknowledged, and respected – especially when it comes to decisions as crucial as accommodation and safe passage. The journey is long, the challenges are vast, but the human potential for empathy, understanding, and change is boundless.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,“We are pioneers and innovators”.,27-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/27/bhm2023-we-are-pioneers/,"Being in community Every year, I take my children to the Black History Month celebrations in Borehamwood, Stevenage in Hertfordshire. There are so many different African flags and markets, and many small businesses selling clothes, fruits, books, pieces of art, clothing, Black skincare products, and various other things. Black writers and film producers are also showcased. There are also book launches, and immigration advice is also given to those who want to know more about their rights or renew their passports. Celebrating our heritage is about celebrating it together: in community with one another. Sharing our voice When I came to this country as a teenager from Nigeria, I knew straight away that I was an immigrant. It was not an easy journey: I felt like I didn’t have a platform to speak or fight. Racism was embedded in every institution, and still is. I began to realise the importance of Black History Month: it is a platform for us to come together and share our voices. It allows our voices, our values, our celebrations, and our pride to be heard by the world. What use are our voices if they are not even heard? This is why Black History being taught in schools is so important. We need to be represented, in our totality and fullness, and the voices of our ancestors must be amplified and heard. This is also why migration charities must also be talking about Black History Month: to ensure that our voices are heard by those in power. Charities need to stop shutting our voices down, or assuming that they know best. This is White saviourism. Do not forget You only know who you are when you understand where you have come from. Darcus Howe The theme for 2023 is “celebrating our sisters”, which is about honouring the vital role Black women have played in history: from literature, art and culture, to music, politics and healthcare. Black women have always been underappreciated and are often not given the credit they deserve. Our achievements as Black people are often appropriated. The world must celebrate Black women, sing our praises, and give us our flowers. But we must celebrate ourselves first. If we don’t celebrate ourselves first, then no-one else will. It is really important to me, as a Black woman, to celebrate, appreciate and honour my heritage, and to remember our ancestors who fought for the life we live today. Our ancestors must live forever and for generations to come- we must not forget them. Black history is history for us all. If we forget our past, where we come from, then nothing will be left for the future. Looking to the future People have dismissed Africa and its people, constantly saying that nothing good comes out of our continent. But we are pioneers and innovators: whether it be Afrobeat music, or films like The Woman King or Wakanda. I am constantly inspired by Black innovation. Our power to innovate is incredible, and we can use it to inspire, and to create the kind of future that we want for the generations to come. I want a future where Black people can collaborate and trade freely with each other. Where our countries are not plunged into further debts by the West. Where we are economically empowered. Where our stolen and looted wealth is returned to us by those who colonised us. I wish for a future where we are free to embrace and celebrate our heritage fully. Where we are able to excel without fear, and not be hindered or limited by systemic oppression or other people’s perceptions of us. Where Black History Month is every month. We don’t need to wait for October to celebrate, we can celebrate our Blackness every day. We have to be hopeful. We have to imagine and plan the future that we want, open our minds to it, and move towards it. We need to look behind us, to know where we are coming from, so that we know where we want to go. We must think about our roots and our struggles, and take lessons from the past, but we must also not entrap ourselves into only looking backwards. We cannot allow ourselves to become trapped by hopelessness or internalise the oppressor’s narrative: that we are destined for or only worthy of the bare minimum. We must look forward too. We must imagine and innovate our way out of this unjust present, into a just future.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,“We made ourselves strong”.,26-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/26/bhm2023-we-made-ourselves-strong/,"Until the lion learns how to write, every story will glorify the hunter. African Proverb. Who’s history? When we speak of history, who’s history are we talking about? When I think about history, I see clear bias. It is not an objective recounting of events, but rather a narrative of Whiteness. Black History Month allows us to correct that bias. To know our present, we have to know our history. And once we know our history, and what work still needs to be done, we can better understand the future and what we want from it. To know where you are going, you have to know where you come from. We are not homogeneous I came to the UK at the age of 7, as a refugee from a rural village in Uganda. My experience as a Black woman and a Ugandan refugee has shaped my understanding of the world, but I cannot claim to speak for or be representative of all Black people nor refugees, or that my words will resonate with all Black people. We are not homogeneous, and we contain multitudes: every Black person has their own story, their own starting point, and their own experiences with class, gender, ability, religion and sexuality, which go on to shape their worldviews. Black History Month should elevate the vast and diverse experiences of Black people, and make space for all of us. Being a Black child in a majority White school was difficult. Once I arrived in the UK, I could feel injustice all around me, without even knowing the word for it. The education of Black history in school was inadequate, and growing up, I remember charities engaging in White saviourism, and poverty and trauma voyeurism. I only became aware of Black History Month as an adult. Black History Month allows me to see individuals who look like me and who share similar stories. Hearing people and listening to their stories is empowering, and also defies the distorted narrative of history that we have been fed. Celebrating our sisters As a Black woman, the theme of this year’s Black History Month is so important to me. As Black women, we are held to a higher standard than most, expected to work twice as hard, expected to expend huge amounts of emotional labour, and expected to sacrifice our personal needs and desires for the comfort of everyone else. I have found myself constantly playing the role of sister, mother and therapist. Black women are expected to tolerate pain, to coddle most individuals, and to be the support system for everyone else. We shouldn’t have to be strong, or resilient. But we are strong, not because our struggles made us strong, but in spite of them. We are strong because we made ourselves strong. We are strong, but we are also vulnerable, and we deserve space to be vulnerable. For me, sisterhood also transcends race. I am part of a beautiful community of amazing women from various backgrounds. We celebrate each other’s strength, but we also support each other, and give each other the space to be vulnerable. The support is reciprocated, as it should be, and the burden doesn’t fall on me as a Black woman to constantly provide comfort. I deserve to put my own needs first, and the community I am a part of honours that. Black Joy As important as Black History Month is, the way that various institutions attempt to celebrate it feels very rushed, forced and uncomfortable. It feels performative and saviourist. What changes are actually being made after October ends? What work is being done throughout the year to elevate Black voices and challenge anti-Blackness? The effort should be constant and long-term, not just during Black History Month. The way that institutions attempt to celebrate Black History Month also strikes me as exploitative. Our trauma becomes something to be consumed, and sometimes it seems that institutions thrive off of our trauma. This feels heavy to witness. There is much emphasis on our pain, struggles, hardships and resilience, but barely any attempts are made to amplify and celebrate our joy. Our history does not begin with enslavement. It would be good for institutions such as schools to recognise the richness and diversity of Black African History prior to this moment. What we are taught in school shapes our psyches growing up. If we are only taught about pain, how does this leave us feeling? If we are only taught about joy, how will our struggle be acknowledged? There needs to be a balance between acknowledging Black pain and elevating Black joy. The fullness of our humanity must be respected: we are not reducible to our trauma. Nor are we reducible to the elements of our culture that society has appropriated for aesthetics. Being a refugee The difficulties I faced in my childhood make me want to continue to support those who are marginalised. And my own experience of displacement has made me realise how important it is for British migration charities to celebrate Black History Month, and to honour Black voices through ethical storytelling that affirms our humanity. Nonconsensual images and videos of suffering and impoverished Black people have dominated the charity landscape for years. These kinds of images affect the way that society views us, so much so that when I was a child, a teacher asked me if I also used to have flies on my mouth, like the children in the videos. Most of my youth consisted of educating classrooms, due to these imbalanced narratives. Growing up, I never felt truly seen. These kinds of images are dehumanising, since they turn our trauma into a spectacle, and present us as passive victims with little to no agency. I am not a victim, nor have I ever seen myself as one. The future Our future is defined on what we are doing now. If we do it right, we will have a brighter future. We cannot look at the future in isolation. The past has an impact on how we feel and act today, and our actions today affect tomorrow. I wake up every morning listening to motivational talks. Even during hard moments, I remind myself of the beautiful things in life, such as slowing down, resting, connecting with nature and community. During difficult times, I remind myself that when I was a child, I didn’t even know if I would survive the night. This grounds me in the present moment, and makes me appreciate what I have access to, and to make the most of it. I know that so many people out there can only dream of my reality, and I am reminded to see life through their perspective. I truly believe that the world needs more empathy. My upbringing has allowed me to see how important it is to have a community of loved ones around you who support and uplift you, and make space for you to be your authentic self. We are all connected and in community. We can use what we have access to in order to stand with others we are in community with. In the words of Maya Angelou: “ I come as one but stand as 10,000 ”.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,“Celebrating our Blackness in its entirety”.,24-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/24/bhm2023-celebrating-our-blackness/,"We were all Black Malawi is known for its humility and compassion, and as the “warm heart of Africa”. As someone from Malawi, I celebrate my Blackness and Black history in the UK through sharing my culture with those around me. I am part of the Ngoni tribe, which is one of the oldest tribes in Africa. It is one of the tribes that helped in the liberation fight against the British colonists. We have a rich culinary and music tradition. When I lived in Malawi, I would watch the news, and I would wonder why people abroad were so obsessed with race. Back home, we were all Black: we were a homogenous race. We celebrated our Blackness by celebrating our specific Malawian cultures: our food, our dress and our languages. We didn’t experience anti-Black racism. But when I arrived in the UK, I began to experience other people’s perceptions of my Blackness, and the oppression and microaggressions that came with it. People would cross the road when they saw me, and treat me like an “invader” that doesn’t deserve to be here. I realised that racism was an extremely important conversation, since it implicates every facet of our lives. And I began to understand the immense importance of Black History Month. Black Remembrance Black History Month is about remembrance. It is a celebration and reflection of the past, of the achievements and struggles of Black people. It elevates the voices and stories of those who have been silenced and have fought for freedom, in order to challenge the omissions, erasure and distortion of our history. But it also involves an understanding of how the past informs our current reality, and how history shapes what we want from the future. Our Sisters This year, Black History Month encourages us to celebrate, honour, and spotlight our sisters, their achievements and their struggles, including their fight against misogynoir. Colourism is something that affects Black women in uniquely devastating ways. Light-skinned Black women are perceived to be more beautiful and more worthy than darker-skinned Black women. Unfortunately, many darker-skinned Black women bleach their skin because of colourism. Colourism is in fact a legacy of the enslavement of Black people. It is important that we unite against anti-Black racism, but also colourism. I often think about the situation of women and girls in Malawi, and there are sadly many patriarchal elements to our culture. Patriarchy is universal, and it manifests itself differently in different contexts. In Malawi, it looks like the expectation of women as housewives, or sadly child marriage: many families who are impoverished will marry off their daughters in order to receive a dowry. In Malawi, there is also a massive issue of period poverty, which means that girls will often miss out on school. The unaffordability of period products and the lack of access to menstrual facilities in schools is a barrier towards girls’ education and negatively impacts their academic performance. When I lived in Malawi, I was a part of the SIC’s (Sanitation Innovations Center) initiative to challenge period poverty . The project taught young people how to create reusable period pads out of locally accessible materials: the waterproof packaging from Malawian sugar can be sewn in between the fleece from unused blankets in order to create a DIY pad. When we reflect on our history, it is important to reflect on where we are, and also on where we want to be: no woman or girl should be denied access to education. We must celebrate the achievements of our Black sisters, not just our cisters . We can see the massive impact of Black trans women, including Marsha P Johnson, in the Stonewall revolution, and their crucial role in securing rights for the queer community. We must also honour the queer Black communities who resist the colonial legacies of anti-gay laws in the African continent, and the queer Black History that has been erased, including in Malawi. Black Migration It is imperative that people understand the interconnectedness of Blackness and migration. Migration has been part of human history for a long time, and the Black experience especially is intrinsically linked to forced migration, and the millions displaced through enslavement and colonialism. When Black asylum seekers and refugees flee to the UK, they experience the violence of racist, Islamophobic and anti-migrant immigration policies. Their displacement, as well as the displacement of people from the Global South more generally, is directly linked to colonial legacies such as poverty, war and conflict. There is also much to be said about the way that Black and Brown asylum seekers are often disbelieved, and their asylum claims are rejected as not being “genuine”, simply on account of their skin tone. I want to learn more about the struggles that Black people face in the UK. Whilst I don’t mind being asked where I am from, I understand that for Black people raised here, that question just reinforces how they will never belong. Anger + joy As a Black migrant, to me Blackness means not belonging. It means that no matter how hard you try, this is not your home. But it also means resilience, strength, beauty and love. History affects the present, and the structural racism that we have experienced and continue to experience does impact our daily lives in a multitude of ways in terms of educational attainment, career prospects and health outcomes. But I am also not a victim. I refuse the victim mentality, because we are not inherently hopeless, passive victims. Something that we do have agency and control over is being unapologetic and hopeful in our Black joy and our roots, but also in our unwavering focus on a future world free from oppression. Our anger at our unjust history and present can be channelled into hope towards the future. Black History Month is about bringing people together in the pursuit of liberation. It is about anti-imperialism and ensuring the total independence of African countries, and their freedom from colonial control. It is about reparations, education and correcting the omissions of history. It is about positive representation by Black people in policy-making. We need representation by those who have the best interests of our community at heart, not those who pander to scapegoating. Representation is about celebrating our Blackness in its entirety, and refusing to assimilate to or imitate Whiteness, or be used as pawns and agents of Empire. We must refuse to eradicate the very fibres that make us who we are. The Black struggle is the bedrock of all other struggles. Let’s be proud of it.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Right to Work Checks + Immigration Raids,23-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/23/immigration-raids-right-to-work/,"Immigration raids incite fear in migrant and migratised communities, while right to work guidance is causing confusion amongst employers. Through both our Hostile Office and Challenge the Checks campaigns, we are looking at how different aspects of legislation such as employment, digital and immigration law clash to create misery for migrant workers. The Government signalled an increase in immigration enforcement raids at the end of 2022 as part of its increasingly regressive stance on immigration. The Home Office established the UK’s first cross-Government ministerial taskforce on immigration enforcement which aims to reduce ‘illegal working’ and employment and “ensure only those eligible can work.” In August 2023, the Home Office announced that civil penalties for employers found to be employing workers without permission to work are to triple. The announcement signified the biggest rise in civil penalties since 2014, rising from £15,000 to £45,000 per worker and up to £60,000 for repeat breaches. Since the start of 2018, around 5,000 penalties have been issued to employers totalling £88.4 million. In just the second quarter of 2023, 377 were issued totalling £5.6 million in value whilst in the first quarter of the year, civil penalties amounted to £6 million. Evidently, immigration raids on workplaces are a highly lucrative income stream for the Home Office. Source: Immigration Enforcement data: Q2 2023 Upon the announcement of the increase in civil penalties, the Home Office stated that in order to avoid a fine, the employer needs to carry out a right to work check and that it “takes only 5 minutes”. However, our Challenge the Checks research has found that right to work guidance is confusing, contradictory and in many cases, the checks simply do not work. For example, the guidance itself states “it will not be possible to conduct a Home Office online right-to-work check in all circumstances, as not all individuals will have an immigration status that can be checked online”. While those who obtained Indefinite Leave to Remain before November 2008 have no digital footprint. Right to work checks are complex and many employers don’t understand the rules. As a result, migrant workers are suffering. Through our Challenge the Checks campaign and Hostile Office campaign, we are committed to exposing the impact of the hostile environment in the workplace. We are raising awareness of the: Impact of immigration raids on migrant and migratised communities How immigration raids are affecting migrant and racialised businesses Contradictions in the overly complex right to work guidance, civil penalties and the impact this is having on migrant workers Technical issues with platforms such as share code error sharing, discrimination from facial recognition software and workers being asked to pay for them Outsourcing of right to work services to third-party providers Right to work checks are broken. Immigration raids are discriminatory. We are calling for right to work checks and raids to stop.

Migrants' Rights Network,MAP: Second Workshop,21-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/21/map-second-workshop/,"On the second day of the workshops, which took place on October 21, 2023, our participants had the privilege of learning from two remarkable speakers, Marzia Babakarkhail and Lara Parizotto, who shared their experiences and wisdom, guiding our fellows towards impactful leadership and personal aspiration. Marzia Babakarkhail, a former Supreme Court Judge from Afghanistan and an advocate for women’s rights, delivered an enlightening talk on “Leadership and Creative Change”. In this workshop, our fellows were exposed to the inspiring journeys of leaders who have taken action to empower migrants. Marzia emphasised the importance of leadership and how our unique experiences can be leveraged to help us become leaders in our own right. The session explored key skills necessary for success and provided invaluable insights into creating systemic change within UK society. Marzia’s own experience as a refugee and her continuous dedication to gender equality and human rights served as a powerful example of the potential impact one can have on the world. In the second workshop of the day, Lara Parizotto, a dedicated migrants’ rights campaigner, led a session titled “Sharing Your Own Aspiration”. Participants were encouraged to delve into their own passions and aspirations, understanding what drives them to make a difference. Lara’s interactive session allowed our fellows to take ownership of their aspirations and recognise their significance in raising awareness about the challenges facing our communities. Through engaging discussions and practical guidance, attendees discovered pathways to become public actors in various sectors, be it voluntary, community, NGO, public policy, civil service, or politics. Marzia and Lara both come from countries marked by humanitarian crises and have experienced challenges as recent migrants in the UK. By sharing their journeys, they not only inspired our participants but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the broader migrant experience beyond the context of Hong Kong. Marzia’s extensive legal and advocacy background in promoting gender equality and human rights, coupled with her ongoing activism, highlighted the immense impact one person can have in advocating for positive change. Lara’s commitment to migrants’ rights, her work as a councillor, and her experiences in engaging with young people and changing the narrative on immigration showcased the power of personal passion and advocacy. These workshops were a powerful continuation of the Migrants’ Aspiration Programme, providing our participants with the tools, inspiration, and knowledge to pursue their goals and make lasting impact on UK society. Some fellows are impressed and deeply moved by Marzia’s perseverance and resilience as well as her work on women’s empowerment and gender equality, while many are also intrigued about the potential collaboration with Migrants Democracy Project (MDP). Our fellows show strong interest in the MPower Political Leadership Programme, and Lara has also offered to help Hongkongers campaign on civic education.

Migrants' Rights Network,Stop Appeasing Your Racist Uncle,11-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/11/stop-appeasing-your-racist-uncle/,"“In my day…” “It’s just a bit of banter.” “You can’t say anything these days!” “It’s political correctness gone mad.” We have undoubtedly heard these comments from older people in our lives. People of a certain age or generation, perhaps a neighbour, relative or family friend, who come out with problematic or bigoted comments. They’ll usually blame their age or make some passing comment that “in their day” things were different or those comments were acceptable (newsflash grandma: just because it was acceptable it doesn’t mean it was morally right!). Society often excuses them and holds up its hands saying “well what can we do, that’s just how they are.” Social norms have dictated that it’s normal to have a bigoted uncle or grandma. But why is this seen to be acceptable? These narrow-minded ideas often relate to the idea that political correctness, abolition or anti-oppression are new, and that anti-racism or critiques of the gender binary are modern ideas. However, many movements have been campaigning for justice for decades (or centuries). Movements for justice are perhaps only more visible now because of modern-day media cycles which fixate on certain issues. This media fixation is often a deliberate attempt to actually undermine these struggles (take the current anti-transphobic rhetoric that has taken hold of our political discourse). We must also remember that for many marginalised people in the past, it was not safe for them to speak up and be visibly engaged in justice movements, or perhaps they simply did not have the platform nor resources to do so. We have a collective responsibility to call out hatred and harmful rhetoric. To not do so is to be complicit, and allow these ideas to continue to permeate through our communities. At what age do we see someone as being beyond educating, or their bigotry as excusable? Insinuating that someone is too old to learn is ageism. Many older people continue to learn from and listen to marginalised groups. This kind of ageism also discredits all the older people who continue to fight for social justice and are on the front line of anti-oppressive movements. It diminishes the solidarity of the older generations who come out early in the morning to defend drag queen story time from fascists. You are never too old to be held to account. Racism (or any other form of discrimination) was never and will never be okay. Stop making excuses for it.

Migrants' Rights Network,World Mental Health Day,10-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/10/world-mental-health-day-2023/,"This year’s World Mental Health Day theme is ‘mental health is a universal human right’. That’s why we want to shine a light on the specific issues migrants, including refugees, face in relation to mental health. Looking at the intersections of immigration status with other aspects of identity is integral to our campaigning and policy work at MRN. We have found that the intersections of ableism around mental health and migration status have been overlooked, which is especially concerning in light of increasing reports of mental distress and abuse in immigration detention. Therefore, we want to use this day to bring attention to the complex needs and experiences of migrants in relation to mental health. Disability and mental health A significant part of disability – any long-term condition concerning physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment(s) –  is mental health, encompassing both permanent and more temporary conditions. The less visible nature of mental health has meant that ableism on these grounds is often ignored. Mental health is a core issue for migrants with disabilities, as many suffer from PTSD after traumatic experiences in their origin country and/or from their journey to the UK. This can be intensified in immigration detention and Home Office accommodation in the UK; our community have told us rates of loneliness and isolation are high, along with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Uncertainty and an increasingly hostile atmosphere in the UK are exacerbated by the treatment of asylum seekers by the contracted accommodation staff. The hostility that many migrants, including refugees, are met with in Britain can be disabling in (re)traumatising people and negatively affecting rehabilitation. Talking about mental health requires more than simply raising awareness of the fact that many people, at some point in their lives, will experience some form of mental health condition. We want to explore the barriers to accessing essential mental health support services for migrants with disabilities. Accessing mental health support Most migrants are not entitled to free NHS healthcare, including mental health support services. The underfunding of NHS mental health services can also mean this may be hard to access or receive quality care that speaks to the specific experiences of displaced people. NGOs may provide similar services for torture survivors, but are limited in their resources. Further, undocumented migrants, those on short-term visas and refused asylum seekers do not have free access to healthcare, including psychiatric treatment, and face upfront charges of 150% of the cost of providing that care. The combination of stigma and fear of a mental health diagnosis negatively impacting asylum applications means that many do not access mental health support or declare mental health issues. Anecdotal evidence shows that asylum seekers with both physical and mental disabilities are common, which may lead to a physical disability being recognised and treated/accommodated, but not a mental health condition. For some , the isolation they feel as asylum seekers with physical disabilities has brought on or exacerbated mental health problems. Their inability to access assistive services, as a result of a lack of awareness of how to access  these services or their disabilities providing a barrier to actively seeking out/accessing these services means that they receive insufficient aid with their conditions, which often contribute to their mental health issues. Additionally, over 61% of asylum seekers experience serious mental distress. This is as a result of trauma from torture, war and persecution in their countries of origin, as well as from the asylum system in Britain, where isolation, poor housing and the experiences of making their claim significantly negatively affect their mental health. The role of the asylum process in causing mental ill-health makes it increasingly unlikely that asylum seekers would feel comfortable seeking support from similar state services. The Hostile Environment exacerbates mental health issues Mental health issues are often exacerbated by the conditions of immigration detention and asylum accommodation. The use of former military sites, with ex-military personnel acting as security, high barbed wire gates, extensive CCTV and the difficulties of leaving asylum accommodation sites leave people feeling isolated. Asylum accommodation is unsuitable for torture and trafficking survivors, as well as people with other mental health needs, but the lack of suitable assessment and screening processes means that there are people still placed in these damaging and unsafe conditions. The mental health effects of the isolation of migrants is likely to increase as the UK Government moves to expand the detention state. In order to ensure that mental health is recognised and protected as a universal human right, we call for an end to border violence and immigration detention. Systems of oppression, such as racism, queerphobia, transphobia, and ableism exacerbate mental ill-health, as well as in immigration detention and other modes of bordering, which can further intensify the harm of these systems. The denial of social and economic rights fundamental to the Hostile Environment, including the denial of safe and decent housing, poverty, combined with the lack of access to mental health support, is itself an extreme mental burden. The Government must end the state-sanctioned oppression of migrants, in immigration detention and anywhere else where the border exists. This includes ending the surveillance of migratised, racialised and queer communities, investing in public services, such as housing and healthcare, and ensuring that those services are free to access, regardless of migration status. This is especially urgent as mental distress and barriers to access care will be heightened for migrants placed at risk of being sent to detention centres in Rwanda, and many more made more precarious by the Inhumane Migration Act. Ableism and disability advocacy are often ignored, particularly in how it relates to navigating the immigration system and deconstructing the idea of who is welcome in the UK. At MRN, we will continue to explore the relationship between disability and migration through our key strategic objective to defy the existing narratives around migration. I believe that mental health is indeed a universal human right and any issues surrounding it should be taken with caution. As an asylum seeker, for me this day is not only about raising awareness but a call for urgent and compassionate interventions for asylum seekers and refugees. I have come to realise that we (asylum seekers) have a complex range of health needs that develop prior to leaving our country of origin, during transit or after arrival in the UK. Sadly, most of us are not aware that we need mental health help. This is so because we sometimes mistakenly believe that once we reach a place of safety, our mental health problems will magically disappear. But this is not the case. Being faced with a hostile environment, social exclusion, poor living conditions, destitution and long waiting period due to the deliberate backlog, often exacerbates our existing trauma for a second chance at life, plunging us into a relentless cycle of suffering. On this day, let’s advocate for a multifaceted approach that encompasses cultural sensitivity, equitable access to mental health services, and a society free from oppression and discrimination. Stop incarcerating asylum seekers after experiencing a mental breakdown/episode! Instead get them the treatment and support they require.

Migrants' Rights Network,Black History Month 2023,30-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/30/black-history-month/,"This Black History Month, we honour the work, resilience and creativity of incredible Black thinkers, activists and theorists in the UK and beyond. We are endlessly appreciative of their knowledge, as it has taught us not only how to make sense of our current world, but to imagine a new one free from oppression. This month, we want to highlight quotes by incredible Black thinkers, touching on themes such as Whiteness, abolition, migration, Black joy, divide and rule, and the erasure of Black history. Intersectionality and anti-oppression drives our work at MRN. We cannot understand migration without understanding histories of race and racism, specifically the ways that Black people have been dehumanised and constructed as “threats” to the nation. Black History Month is a celebration of all the important work that has been done, but is also a reminder of all the work we need to do to stand in solidarity with Black communities and dismantle systemic racism in all its forms. Whiteness Whiteness has always functioned as a tool of domination. Akala in his book Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire (Two Roads Publishers, 2019) The true focus of revolutionary change is never merely the oppressive situations which we seek to escape, but that piece of the oppressor which is planted deep within each of us…Revolution is not a one time event. Audre Lorde in her book Sister Outsider (Crossing Press, 1984) . The psychosis of Whiteness is not reserved for White people, it is a distortion that is rooted in Western society and can be reproduced by those of any hue. Thus is the power of the psychosis…Western capitalism is built on and sustained by a system of racism that exploits the people and nations of the darker parts of the globe. It is also sustained by a series of myths of progress and enlightenment about the good that the West has wrought. The dissonance between the reality and these myths is too great for the system to survive, so Whiteness becomes a psychosis that prevents society from engaging in the disturbing reality. This psychosis of Whiteness is essential to understand when fighting racism. There is no rational argument to those trapped in a psychosis, as there is no reasoning with Whiteness. Until the conditions that create Whiteness are destroyed, the psychosis will govern the thoughts and actions of Western society. Kehinde Andrews in his book The Psychosis of Whiteness: Surviving the Insanity of a Racist World (Allen Lane Publishers, 2023) . When we revolt it’s not for a particular culture. We revolt simply because, for many reasons, we can no longer breathe. Slogan adapted from Frantz Fanon ’s quote “It is not because the Indo-Chinese bas discovered a culture of his own that he is in revolt. It is because quite simply.. it was, in more than one way, becoming impossible for him to breathe” in his book Black Skin, White Masks (Penguin Classics, 2021) . There is no English history without that other history. Stuart Hall in Chapter 2 of his book Essential Essays, Volume 2: Identity and Diaspora (Duke University Press, 2018) . Black history is a series of missing chapters from British history. David Olusoga in Arifa Akbar’s “David Olusoga: ‘There’s a dark side to British history, and we saw a flash of it this summer’” (The Guardian, November 2016) . Not seeing race does little to dismantle racist structures or improve the lives of people of colour. In order to do so, we must see race. We must see who benefits from their race, who is affected by negative stereotyping of theirs, and on whom power and privilege is bestowed – not just because of their race, but also their class and gender. Seeing race is essential. Reni Eddo-Lodge in her book Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race (Bloomsbury Publishers, 2018) . We are socialised into systems that cause us to conform and believe our worth is connected to how much we can produce. Our constant labour becomes a prison that allows us to be disembodied. We become easy for the systems to manipulate, disconnected from our power as divine beings and hopeless. We forget how to dream. This is how grind culture continues. We internalise the lies and in turn become agents of an unsustainable way of living. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). Divide and rule Amnesia implies a passivity, a condition subconsciously visited upon the unwilling forgetter. With Britain’s racial past we witness something far more active, conscious and deliberate. The forgetting doesn’t simply happen to us; we are at great pains to make it happen for everybody. Gary Younge in his article “Lest we remember: How Britain buried its history of slavery” (The Guardian, March 2023) . “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing”. Malcolm X . The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. Audre Lorde at “The Personal and the Political” Panel during the Second Sex Conference (October 29, 1979) . We have to talk about liberating minds as well as liberating society . Angela Davis . White people love playing ‘divide and rule’. We should not play their game. Diane Abbott on Twitter in January 2012. The concept of laziness is a tool of the oppressor. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). So here’s my experience of growing up in Britain; it was always a case of making sure that I was grateful. Musa Okwonga in his article “The Ungrateful Country” (Byline Times, April 2020). Loving ourselves and each other deepens our disruption of the dominant systems. They want us unwell, fearful, exhausted, and without deep self-love because you are easier to manipulate when you are distracted by what is not real or true. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). Imagination This planet is for everyone, borders are for no one. Benjamin Zephaniah in his novel Refugee Boy (Bloomsbury Publishers, 2017) . Imagination is one of the most powerful modes of resistance that oppressed and exploited folks can use. bell hooks in Tricia Hersey’s Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022) . In predominantly white countries, it’s easy for us to forget that we are part of the global majority, that we are connected to billions of people across the world whose dreams for and actions toward liberation align with our own. Lady Phyll in “5 Global LGBTQ+ Leaders you Should Know About this Pride Month” (Equality Now, June 2021) . In one way or another, we all transition. Munroe Bergdorf in her book Transitional (Bloomsbury Publishers, 2023) . A people’s art is the genesis of their freedom. Claudia Jones in her article “A people’s art is the genesis of their freedom” (West Indian Gazette, 1960). Survival is not the end goal for liberation. We must thrive. We must rest. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). We struggle and fight for our joy – an unreserved and unapologetic joy that springs from our ability to live as we are. It’s a joy worth fighting for and it’s this joy that links all of our struggles together. Lady Phyll in her letter “No amount of bullying, racism, sexism or misogyny will hold us back” (Gay Times, October 2018) . Begin by thinking of love as an action rather than a feeling. bell hooks in her book all about love: new visions (HarperCollins Publishers, 2016) . Abolition Abolition is not primarily a negative strategy. It’s not primarily about dismantling, getting rid of, but it’s about re-envisioning. It’s about building anew. Angela Davis in “Angela Davis on Abolition, Calls to Defund Police, Toppled Racist Statues & Voting in 2020 Election” (Democracy Now, June 2020) . Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare. Audre Lorde in her book A Burst of Light: and Other Essays (Dover Publications, 2017) . Nobody’s free until everybody’s free. Fannie Lou Hamer in her speech delivered at the Founding of the National Women’s Political Caucus in Washington DC (10 July 1971). It’s a collective struggle and your struggle must be my struggle and my struggle must be yours. Lady Phyll in Kirsty Osei-Bempong’s “gal-dem in conversation with Lady Phyll, director of Black Pride UK” (galdem, June 2016). No pride for some of us without liberation for all of us . Attributable to Marsha P Johnson with the consent of the person who coined the phrase. We must believe we are worthy of rest. We don’t have to earn it. It is our birthright. It is one of our most ancient and primal needs. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). The moment we choose to love we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others. bell hooks in her book Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations (Routledge Publishers, 2006) .

Migrants' Rights Network,Identity Trouble: how stereotypes inform Chinese immigrant identification,29-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/29/identity-trouble-chinese-immigrant-identification/,"My different names When I moved to London two years ago, I lived in student accommodation. Communal spaces became a natural place to socialise. I usually use my English name with random strangers I meet first, as I prefer not to spend too much time dwelling on “awkward” pronunciations for those who are unfamiliar with Mandarin. Despite their sincere efforts, my name still is mispronounced most of the time. Once, upon hearing that I had an English name, a White male I encountered in the study room laughed flippantly and asked, what’s your REAL name? I was deeply shocked. I had never experienced such ignorance, especially as I was usually around my flatmates, most of whom had rich international experience. For my generation (Post-95 or GenZ), it was not rare to have an English name from an early age, either for the purposes of the compulsory school English curriculum or after-school English classes, or simply based on personal preference. It is also a mark of how China has proactively embraced globalisation during the era I grew up in. I was not particularly bothered by what people referred to me as. My different names within different communities became different facets of me, which I embraced as part of my identity. When Caroline Humphrey was carrying out her research in Mongolia in 2009, she stated that names do not merely create a ‘relation’ with the person being named, but a triangulation, which takes place in the interactive space between the person who is named, the people who use the name, and the connotations of the name itself. “What’s your real name?” The logic behind this question, posed to me in the study room, is pretty simple – you “should” have an “authentic” Chinese name if you are an “authentic” Chinese person. This assumption reveals such ignorance and laziness – it is an attempt to fit people of different nationalities and ethnicities into tightly constrained boxes without any willingness to understand the complexities inherent to our identities. Sadly, this logic expands itself into a network of stereotypes and is pervasive across our society. Ethnic Chinese people’s multifaceted identities are often distilled into a vague, one-dimensional mask, sharing the same ideology, personality, and interests. Notwithstanding that defining ‘Chinese’ must interrogate the complicated history of migration and the tricky dynamics of political power, even pointing only to present-day China reveals huge diversity. As in any country, there is a myriad of complexities among communities and groups with diverse ethnic, religious, linguistic affiliations, economic and social backgrounds in China. As China has become an impossible economy to ignore, the prevailing image of Chinese immigrants in the UK has shifted from undocumented labourers in “low-skilled” industries, or survivors seeking political asylum, to “crazy rich” tourists and students splashing out on luxury goods and property. However, there are diverse layers between these two extremes. For some young Chinese immigrants, these stereotypical preconceptions and binaries restrict their potential to become part of various professional sectors in the global community. “Chinese [people] are not creative enough, you guys are good executors”. This was what Lin was constantly told by her White male supervisor when she started her first job as a content creator. Critical thinking and creativity are deemed to be values of Western education, and for Chinese people, these are labelled as skills that need to be acquired by studying abroad. Lin felt uncomfortable but had still internalised the idea, even though she had contributed core content to social media accounts with over 100,000 followers and was adored by many. Lin was one of the interviewees for my MA dissertation, in which I explored the identification¹ and sense of belonging of young professionals from mainland China in London. Encountering such stereotypes and being restricted accordingly was unfortunately commonplace among the interlocutors. Other stories include professional translators specialising in linguistics, who have been limited in their career progression because they are not native English speakers. For these Han Chinese professionals in the UK, China has not disappeared from their lives just because they moved to another country. Many of them are leaning heavily towards ‘Chineseness’ for identification as it becomes their distinctive label under the gaze of the host country². The reason behind this is that identification is an ongoing process. It depends on how we perceive ourselves, how others perceive us, and how we interpret those perceptions. In the workplace, even relatively privileged well-educated young professionals are still perceived as the Other within a set of Western ideals. In turn, being seen as different leads these people to internalise themselves as different. In other words, their awareness of being Chinese in London is a result of being perceived as Chinese first. Lin’s story with her supervisor ends up having a dramatic twist. As he joined another company, Lin took over the team and after a few months, she found herself not only a good executor but also a good creator – a task which Chinese people supposedly could not have done well. The previous supervisor, however, still sent the group work of Lin’s team to a new client and claimed it was his work despite her grievances. Lin, who finally no longer had to put up with the workplace power dynamic of this male superior, voiced all her grievances over a phone call with him. However, Lin’s experience is perhaps fortunate in that there are still many interlocutors who are trapped in cycles of self-doubt, as a result of the labels that have been imposed on them by society. “…trouble is inevitable and the task, how best to make it, what best way to be in it”. The title of this blog is inspired by the renowned feminist scholar Judith Butler’s book “Gender Trouble”. Butler’s idea was to challenge (or trouble) the binary view of sex, gender, and sexuality. Therefore, “Identity trouble” implies a willingness to question and disrupt societal norms and expectations associated with identity categories. As East and South East Asian Heritage Month draws to a close, it might be useful to think about the specific parts (cultures, ethnicities, and languages) that make up this complex conglomerate of East and South East Asia. Who has the authority to define our identities? Are we free to self-identify? What assumptions underlie these identity labels? Do these assumptions help us grow or restrict us? Perhaps, there is a need to dwell upon what labels offer, but also on what they take away. ¹ I use the word identification to suggest that identity is a fluid concept, that it is constantly changing as the self interacts with itself and with the world, and that individuals have the agency to define their identities and explore who they are beyond the limitations imposed by labels. ² The Han Chinese community are a privileged majority in the People’s Republic of China. They hardly reflect on or think about their “Chineseness” in their daily lives. But in the UK they become a minority, and are seen as Chinese, and so they become more aware and conscious of their “Chineseness”. The “Chinese” label does not need to function as a primary identifier in China as it is structurally embedded within people’s identities, although many of them actually have aspirations to escape these nationalistic constraints.

Migrants' Rights Network,“Our heritage is dynamic + constantly changing”,29-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/29/our-heritage-is-dynamic-constantly-changing/,"I am a Hongkonger who has been exiled to the UK. My parents are from mainland China, feel culturally and ethnically Chinese, and are first generation migrants in Hong Kong. We waited decades to be reunited with our family in China. I see how the term “Chinese” has been weaponised, and it makes me not want to associate with it, because the assumption is that I must be pro-Chinese Government. But I am not, and I fled Hong Kong precisely because I was critical of the Chinese Government. How I relate to the term ESEA In Hong Kong, there is no concept of “Asian” or “East and South East Asian”. Most of us are Hongkongers, Han Chinese, South Asian, or non-Asians. From the perspective of foreign expats and elite middle classes in Hong Kong, this city is always seen as a melting pot between ‘East and West’ and a bustling international hub. But to many local residents living in grassroots communities however, there is not much multiculturalism. So, for Hongkongers coming to the UK, the concept of a joint East and South East Asian identity is a new one. It may take months and years to adapt to, since this collective identity was never something that Hongkongers would have even thought about or been conscious of. In Hong Kong, there is not much attention given to anti-racism. The concept of race is a new topic for those raised in Hong Kong. There are many Pakistani and Indian second generation migrants who are born and raised in Hong Kong. Cantonese speakers will often refer to South Asian domestic migrant workers in derogatory terms. Han Chinese communities do not make much effort to reach out to or welcome South Asian communities, and they are also not represented in mainstream media or pop culture. They experience what it is like to be a minority in Hong Kong, and when we come to the UK, we are suddenly no longer the majority: we are minorities too. So, navigating this shift from being part of the majority to being a minority is very interesting and eye opening. It is so important to have ESEA solidarity, but also Asian solidarity, and solidarity with communities beyond Asia. We should be proud to identify under the ESEA label. It is a meaningful label under which we can build solidarity and community. As Hongkongers In Britain , we have encouraged our Outreach Coordinator to do more work on ESEA Heritage Month. We have also worked with the Chinese Community Centre to rename themselves as the ESEA Community Centre. Our organisation was also invited to the PM’s Lunar New Year Celebrations. This used to be commonly referred to as “Chinese New Year”, but the name Lunar New Year is obviously more inclusive, since many who are not Chinese will celebrate this occasion. Lunar New Year is something that unites many of us across the ESEA community. As East and South East Asians, we are also united by our experiences during the height of the Covid pandemic. Many of us have been subjected to racially abusive language, including myself, and have been called “dirty”, simply because we are East or South East Asian. As a Hongkonger in London, the sheer diversity of ethnicities and cultures has impressed me. I see BLM and the Windrush Generation have their own dedicated shelves in London libraries, and I think this is so important. I live in an area in London where there is a large South Asian community. Many Bollywood films are shown in the local cinema, and there are many South Asian restaurants and food shops in my area. This inspires me to get to know and learn about other cultures, histories, and identities. Initiatives such as ESEA Heritage Month can help with this type of cross-cultural understanding. Marginalised voices need to be heard, and as a society we must listen to the stories, struggles and histories of various migrant and migratised groups. Heritage is living culture ‘Heritage’ is the lessons you have taken over decades and centuries, and how you bring them into the present moment. It’s about taking our culture and moving it forward, whether that be medicine, architecture, language, music or political philosophy. Some people think that traditions should tightly control and dictate people’s behaviours, but heritage should be about holding on to elements of the past whilst also being able to change what no longer serves us. Due to the nature of being a colony, Hong Kong culture was once only about practicality, and how to improve one’s economic situation and adjust to new financial situations. But the new generations, especially since 2019, care about protest, social movements, the environment, cultural heritage preservation, humanity, revolution, and the struggle for democracy, autonomy and freedom. This collective struggle for a just society is part of Hong Kong’s heritage. Our heritage is not just trade, modern architecture, financial centres and skyscraper skylines, it is the people and their aspirations. Heritage is dynamic: it doesn’t just involve the past, but also the future. New generations bring new elements to our collective heritage and make it better. Our spirit is still premature, but slowly Hong Kong is developing a spiritual and cultural heritage centred on humanity. There is a stereotype that we are obedient and submissive: but our revolutionary heritage proves this to be a myth. British society needs to listen to our heritage, and take on board the lessons that our heritage can provide. We see ourselves as pioneers, bringing our values and lessons to the UK. This is why the MAP Programme is so important: it allows us an avenue to implement change based on our values and the lessons we have learnt. ESEA Heritage Month: cultural or political? Most people think of heritage as something strictly cultural, about finding common ground beyond the political. And it makes sense in some ways to conceptualise ESEA heritage as something cultural. This is because our struggle for human rights and political issues in Hong Kong may not be shared by other East and South East Asian communities beyond Hong Kong (and Taiwan, since Taiwan also faces CCP aggression). Their political struggles may be different. However, Orientalism and experiences of racial abuse during the pandemic do unite us politically as East and South East Asian migrants in the UK. And sometimes, culture and politics can merge. The Milk Tea Alliance flag: representing Thai milk tea, Hong Kong milk tea and Taiwanese milk tea. Milk Tea Alliance artwork. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, the online human rights movement- the Milk Tea Alliance – was started by Hong Kong, Taiwanese and Thai activists, to protest against authoritarianism. This united the political struggle across Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia through the symbol of milk tea, which has many varieties across East and South East Asia. Hong Kong’s Pillar of Shame (photo via BBC News) Sunflower Seeds, 2010, Ai Wei Wei via TATE Apple Man, 2023, Lumli Lumlong via @lumlilumlong_ The cultural is often political. Art and culture is often used in service of the oppressor, but it can also be a political tool for the oppressed. I have met many exiled Hong Kong painters and sculptors, and I often wonder how their art can be used as a vehicle for political expression. My friends Lumli Lumlong have repeatedly been targeted by the CCP for their political artwork. The Hong Kong Pillar Of Shame commemorates those who died in the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989. In 2023, the sculpture was seized by Hong Kong police. Art is sometimes far more politically powerful than words and speech. Ai Wei Wei has repeatedly been targeted by the CCP for his politically charged work in exposing corruption. Looking to Lunar New Year Lunar New Year is perhaps our most important festival in Hong Kong, and a key part of our heritage. It is a values driven celebration, symbolising unity, family and love. The actions of those in power directly violate the ethos of compassion of this celebration. This celebration, and our heritage as a whole, can guide us towards social justice and can unify us across struggles and continents. Our spiritual, cultural and political heritage is beautiful. We must be proud of our heritage and protect it. East and South East Asian Heritage Month is an amazing opportunity to take control of the narrative and share our stories and heritage on our own terms.

Migrants' Rights Network,Open Letter rejecting the Home Secretary’s abhorrent comments,28-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/28/open-letter-rejecting-home-sec-comments/,"We, the undersigned, condemn the comments made by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, on Tuesday that promote hostility towards migrants and migratised communities across Europe through racist and xenophobic rhetoric around “integration”. In her speech the Home Secretary named immigrants an “existential challenge for the political and cultural institutions of the West”. She referred to rapid and extreme cultural change, high rates of immigration, and the “failure” of migrants to “integrate”. This comes amidst her proposals to abandon the 1951 Refugee Convention in favour of stricter measures to limit the eligibility for refugee protection. This is abhorrent- the Refugee Convention should be expanded to explicitly include more grounds: including sexuality and gender, and climate emergencies. This rhetoric is not new; it draws upon decades-old xenophobia that positions non-White migrants as a “threat” and as a security problem to be dealt with. This draws on the Great Replacement Theory – a White supremacist myth, that has resulted in numerous attacks on migrants and other racialised and marginalised communities across Europe in recent years. Blaming “multiculturalism” as the major European “crisis” is misguided and malicious. The real threat to unity is Government scapegoating of migrants, which sows division in our communities. After facing criticism, the Home Secretary has doubled down on this punitive system. She advocates raising the barrier for persecution to the point where people already have to have suffered torture, abuse, and other cruel treatment, rather than experiencing a threat or intense fear of these conditions. This begs the question of how much harm is enough? As more people become displaced due to global crises that Western governments refuse to address or acknowledge, and indeed have caused, it is alarming that many, like the Home Secretary, appear intent on increasing hostility and raising the bar for protection. We cannot allow this kind of divisive and hostile rhetoric to be normalised. We call instead for a humane, compassionate, and welcoming migration system that does not treat people coming to our countries as issues to be solved and numbers to be reduced. We condemn this latest attack on migrants, and we reject the notion that migrants present an existential “threat” to our political and cultural rights and institutions. We stand in unconditional solidarity with migrants and resist the division that the Government is pushing with its words. To sign our open letter, click here .",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Everyone has the right to protection,26-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/26/everyone-has-the-right-to-protection/,"The Home Secretary is giving the green light for discrimination against marginalised and oppressed groups, particularly women and queer people,  with the backing of the State. At a time where hate crime is on the rise in the UK and instability is increasing across the globe, this move is highly dangerous. Her assumption that people who face discrimination are wrongly being given refugee status undermines the whole point of refugee protections. With the threshold for qualifying as a refugee already being so high, it is concerning that this Government wants to limit access to refugee protection even further. The reasons people flee are complex and numerous, including discrimination, economic instability and climate change which are all threats to someone’s dignity and quality of life. We are appalled that the Home Secretary has stated refugee protection should not be granted to those who are facing or are fearing discrimination. Refugee conventions exist to provide sanctuary for people fleeing factors including persecution and discrimination. Warnings from history have clearly shown the need for international protections for refugees, particularly in the wake of the Holocaust. The Home Secretary believes that the Refugee Convention is not “fit for the modern age” because the threshold is too low. When in reality, the Refugee Convention is not fit for any age because the threshold is far too high. We will not stop fighting for a world where everyone has the right to protection.",,,,,

Additionally, Ali Torabi, an advocate for social change, shared his inspiring journey as an asylum seeker who later became a prominent figure in the UK’s policy and campaign strategy. His experiences and insights served as a source of motivation for the attendees, encouraging them to actively strive for positive changes in UK society. Participants expressed a deep appreciation for the communal space provided by the programme, emphasising its important role as a vital bridge connecting newcomers with the broader community. The shared enthusiasm among the fellows for this space reflects their collective eagerness to engage more actively in the UK’s policy-making landscape. Participants said they were excited to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, all united in their pursuit of a better future. The sense of unity among participants underscores the programme’s success in creating a supportive community that goes beyond geographical and cultural boundaries. Looking ahead, the success of the initial workshops sets a promising tone for the upcoming sessions. We’re excited to see how the programme and participants progress!",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Migrants’ Aspiration Programme for Hongkongers,20-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/20/migrants-aspiration-programme-hongkongers/,"The Migrants’ Aspiration Programme (MAP) is a Migrants’ Rights Network programme in collaboration with Hongkongers in Britain which aims to support participants’ development as community and political leaders. The programme builds on the success of MRN’s previous Migrants’ Aspiration Programme which ran from Jan 2022 until Feb 2023. The Greater London Authority (GLA) launched the Hong Kong Community Fund in 2023 with the aim of supporting Hongkongers in London and to help them build a sense of belonging in their new communities. MRN was successful in our application for funds and we have launched our free six-month training for any Hong Kong migrant in the UK looking to lead and make a difference. Why Hongkongers? Hong Kong has a unique identity and complex history. As a result of the Opium Wars and subsequent treaties in the mid-19th century, China ceded Hong Kong to the British Empire. The two countries agreed that China would essentially lease Hong Kong to Britain for 99 years. On 1 July 1997, Britain transferred authority of Hong Kong to China and ended 150 years of British rule. Hong Kong became, and remains, a Special Administrative Region (SAR). A key condition of the transfer was something that has become known as the ‘one country, two systems’ policy. This sought to ensure that Hong Kong’s economic, political and judicial systems were kept distinct from mainland China for 50 years. However, over the years, it has become increasingly evident that China is intent on encroaching on the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people. The famous 2014 ‘Umbrella Movement’ saw protests break out across Hong Kong when China announced that only Beijing-approved candidates could run in the 2017 elections in the SAR. In June 2020, the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China unanimously passed a new national security law for Hong Kong that came into immediate effect. This law criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign countries. This legislation is arguably purposely vague to encompass a wide range of activities. Evidence provided to the Home Affairs Select Committee by individuals from Hongkongers in Britain in January 2021 demonstrated the “severe political deterioration” in Hong Kong and widespread safety fears many had. In January 2021, the UK Government created a Hong Kong British Nationals (Overseas) (BN(O)) visa. This allows people from Hong Kong with BN(O) status and their dependent family members to come to the UK to live, work and study on a five year visa. This also gives them a route to permanent settlement and British citizenship. However, there have been numerous challenges for people arriving from Hong Kong. Many have struggled to adjust and thrive in their new communities. Reports of loneliness, mental health issues and difficulty finding work has caused hardship for some Hongkongers with some dying by suicide . Through the Migrants’ Aspiration Programme for Hongkongers, we want to place power and resources into their hands so they can create the positive changes they want to see for themselves and for other people from Hong Kong. Annie Tsang, like many Hongkongers, cherishes the opportunity to move to the UK with her husband and children. While being a volunteer for the first few months for the new London community where she is settling down, she experienced many emotions: she was excited about being registered as a voter, nervous about getting her children into a good school, and as a mid-career professional, she spent a few months finding a job. She joined many events that could maintain her self-identity as Hongkonger, such as arts and films festivals, carnivals, craft and food markets, and even protests and rallies for social justice in Hong Kong. She also attends church and volunteers for community and charitable services with many British locals and those activities made her feel a part of such a vibrant and autonomous community. Looking to the future Annie is just one of many Hongkongers in the UK. Like many others on the BN(O) visa scheme, settling into the UK has presented its challenges and being far from home is incredibly difficult. But she is determined to speak up to the challenges and injustices in our society and work to embolden her fellow Hongkongers to thrive in their new communities. Annie feels the word ‘migrant’ has become a negative word. She wants to reclaim the word ‘migrant’ and show Hongkongers, as well as other migrant communities, that being a migrant can be a powerful force for good. Like other migrants from Hong Kong, Annie wants to see more support and access to mental health services, employment, education and many other areas. MAP for Hongkongers is part of a new stage of empowerment which can help Hongkongers flourish and lead new movements for change.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Statement: seven day notice eviction period,19-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/19/seven-day-notice-eviction-period/,"Refugees will now only have seven days notice before being evicted from their asylum support accommodation. This “move-on” notice period falls drastically short of allowing refugees the time they need in order to secure alternative accommodation, and subsequently will subject many to houselessness. It makes no sense for our Government to recognise someone’s asylum claim, commit to helping them, and then allow them only seven days to plan for the rest of their lives. The housing crisis is a product of various Government privatisation policies such as Thatcher’s right to buy scheme, and a capitalist ethos that treats our right to a home as a mere privilege. This crisis impacts all of us and we need radical change in the housing and rental sector in the UK. For migrants, including refugees, navigating this complex and hostile landscape is even more difficult and the Government should not be exacerbating this. Housing is a human right, and we believe everyone deserves access to a safe home, irrespective of their migration status. Homelessness is entirely preventable. The Government must ensure that refugees have time to find secure housing, and access the support they need to move on with their lives.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,"Abolition, not reform",08-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/08/abolition-not-reform-september-2023-newsletter/,"Dear supporters, Whether it’s the inhumane Migration Act, the crackdown on undocumented workers, or the Government’s appalling asylum accommodation plans, this Government’s cruelty truly knows no bounds. This month, we have reflected on how the Hostile Environment continues to worsen, but also on how mainstream approaches to migrant justice actually legitimise and strengthen the harmful systems we are all fighting against. In this newsletter, we share our Civil Society article and International Day of Charity blog post that argue for abolitionist approaches to migrant justice. This is a conversation we will continue to engage with as we move into an anti-oppression space. This month, we have also been busy calling out the Government’s cruel policies. We coordinated an open letter against its cruel accommodation plans, and also spoke to Al Jazeera about cruel colonial legacies and the need for safe routes. Finally, we share updates from our Words Matter campaign, and our new Hong Kong Migrants’ Aspiration Programme! Thank you for your ongoing support.

Migrants' Rights Network,International Day of Charity,05-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/05/international-day-of-charity/,"International Day of Charity fundamentally exists to celebrate the role charity plays in the world alongside notions of philanthropy. However, at MRN, we believe this day should mark a time for much-needed reflection. As members of civil society, we have to be honest with ourselves about why the charity sector exists, and must reckon with the truth about the space we inhabit. The 5th September was chosen to mark the death of Mother Teresa. This fact tells us a lot about how we are prone to celebrate charity rather than critically engage with its existence. Mother Teresa is perhaps best known for receiving a Nobel Peace prize “for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitute a threat to peace”. The truth is more complex and arguably darker. Mother Teresa is a highly controversial and criticised figure whom, to many, embodies White saviorism. At MRN, we are constantly reflecting about the role of charity, particularly in migration advocacy. In a recent Civil Society article , we asked the question: as migrants’ rights advocates, can we truly be committed to achieving justice while advocating for reforms that keep oppressive systems intact? Transformation not reform In the midst of an increasingly hostile and divisive atmosphere for social justice where the Government is implementing more regressive legislation, the default position can end up being a defence of the status quo. We all work in this sector because we want to reduce suffering and fight for what is right. But often, our desire for immediate change can cause us to become indifferent, and accept concessions at the expense of our end goals. Equity for migrants and racialised people cannot be achieved through our current systems. They are inherently racist and colonial in nature, and so there is no fixing what is purposefully designed to oppress. We must as a sector look towards abolitionist alternatives centred on collective care. This involves ending the criminalisation of migration in all its forms, including ending surveillance, detention, and deportation. We must understand the root causes of the systems we exist within, reject division and build solidarity. Charity industrial complex The charity industrial complex often engages in modern-day colonialism, extraction and domination. It extracts radical revolutionary knowledge and repackages it as neoliberal reformism and single-issue politics. It sanitises violent, colonial histories by taking on the role of a “benevolent” saviour to the Global South. The concessions that charities demand of the Government will only ever cushion and alleviate the effects of oppression ever so slightly, whilst keeping structures and systems of domination (such as capitalism and racism) intact. The existence of the charity industrial complex legitimises the status quo: it normalises the  state’s failure and refusal to provide life’s necessities to its population and those seeking its help. Charities are a symptom of our current world, but also consolidate it. As individuals working in the charity sector, we must expose the oppression upon which the third sector is built, through our campaigning work. We must stop legitimising and normalising harmful policies by centring our entire purpose on minor legislative amendments. We must hope for a world where the work we do is rendered obsolete, and we must make that known. This is the only way we can meaningfully disrupt anything. But disruption is not the abolition and dismantling of harmful systems. Disruption is awareness building: it cultivates our awareness of the fact that systems need to be dismantled and abolished, since harm reduction is not good enough. Harm reduction is not the ceiling to which we should aspire, and we should be loud about this in our campaigning work. Dismantling can only be achieved through a bottom-up struggle. Charities must only have a secondary supportive role to play in all of this, especially those that are White and non lived-experience led. They will never be the driving force behind movements for liberation: people will.",,,,,

Migrants' Rights Network,"Let’s talk about (Brown) sex, baby",18-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/18/lets-talk-about-brown-sex-sahm/,"As we mark South Asian Heritage Month and as part of our wider work around reclaiming certain narratives and tackling stigma, people in our Network are sharing their stories with us. Anisah Osman Britton, author of Brown Bodies , shares her experience of belonging as part of the East African Indian diaspora in the UK and how she learnt to fight back against colonial-era feelings of shame around sex and relationships that were forced on colonised communities. Colonialist Victorian values were forced on racialised people and these taboos and harmful narratives shape harmful Western perceptions of minoritised groups today. But members of diasporic migrant communities are taking back the narrative. In this piece, she shares her journey of embracing the intricate histories of feminism, sex and power in religion, literature and colonised history. As a Brown person, it often feels like you’re putting your reputation, family name and prospects on the line just by uttering that tiny, singular syllable word, s-e-x. The taboo of all taboos. But here we go! If talking about it outloud makes one other person talk about it outloud, then it’s worth it. Growing up, I always felt the absence of conversations about s-e-x. Our communities — in my case, the East African Indian diaspora — lacked conversation about pleasure, self love, trust, body positivity, confidence, vulnerability, intimacy, fun, about why religions tell you to wait until marriage. There was also no talk about pain, sexual health, fertility difficulties, loss, ongoing consent within relationships, lack or loss of desire or fear. It was always ‘no sex before marriage’ or ‘don’t get pregnant’. I knew I wasn’t going to have sex before marriage. My faith was my guide. When I consciously made that decision, I was about 13 and at school in India. I was surrounded by people with a mixture of outlooks, including religious girls and boys who saw sex as an act that took place within a marriage — I wasn’t an outlier. It made it easy to be confident and comfortable in who I was and in my body. When you’re 13, you’re going through enough changes as it is, that wasn’t another thing I needed. Then, I moved back to the UK, when I was 14 and did my final years of secondary school at an inner city girls school. One thing about inner city schools is they’re filled with kids from every diaspora. It’s the utopia we were promised when they said ‘multicultural society’. In that mix, I found my beliefs understood by the Black Christian girls who attended the pentecostal church near my house at the weekend, the Pakistani Muslim girls who I wasn’t cool enough to hang out with but who would give me the nod of sisterhood when it came to conversations about sex, the White girls who’d grown up in single parent houses and had sworn off sex until after university and everyone else in between who’d been indoctrinated into this mix and had learnt to accept that all of it was ‘normal’. But college? Boy, did things change. It felt like everyday someone was losing their virginity. In their stories, my choices were questioned. ‘Don’t you want to know ?’ ‘Aren’t you worried that they’re not going to be good at it and then you’re stuck with them?’ ‘Don’t you have…needs?’ And the games of assimilation began. Depending on who I spoke to, my story changed. To the cute boy in the library, I said I was waiting for the right guy. To the girls on my course, I was experimenting. To the Islamic society, I was waiting until marriage. I felt lost. My body no longer felt like my own. And I became obsessed with sex. Not with the act of it, but how it affected and impacted everything . In English literature, I looked for the author’s motivation and more often than not, sex. In the canteen, I watched how boys changed how they spoke when they were talking to someone attractive — sex. I observed the Christian and Muslim girls talk about marriage more than any other of my friends — sex. I watched myself change as my faith clashed with the Western world’s expectation of how I used my body. I observed myself become more anxious about articulating my faith and my beliefs around sex. And mostly? I discovered my own obsession with sex. I learnt about women’s rights to pleasure and sexual fulfilment in Islam. I read about the erotic history of India. I horrifyingly discovered the role of colonialism in creating and forcing people to feel shame. I explored the world of erotic literature from South America. I found myself in history. I found my voice in the voice of authors. I found my faith confirmed by stories of love. I found my anger in the lack of inclusion for different normalities. The intertwinement of faith and culture with pleasure can be beautiful. Our histories are rich with it. But it can be messy, there are tons of nonsense articles and bad faith players online and so much ‘fake news’ is passed down under the pretence of ‘religion’ or culture. And we need to talk about it. We need to talk about the fact women have painful sex their entire lives because they’ve been told it’s normal. We need to talk about men feeling like they need to know it all when it comes to sex and the barriers it’s putting up to their pleasure. As Kapil Gupta said when I interviewed him for Brown Bodies . We need to talk about the repression in our communities that keeps our desire locked up. If you suppress your feelings for long enough, it leads to numbness — a feeling of emptiness and an absence of emotion. We need to talk about why we see sex as dirty, secret and quiet. We need to talk about why our communities struggle to seek legitimate help when it comes to sex and sexual health. We need to talk about how many people are hiding: their sexuality, their internal gender battles and their partners from a different faith. We need to talk about the challenges individuals face while they try to uphold religious and cultural beliefs whilst navigating the Western world’s expectations of how you use your body. “When I moved to London, a friend warned me how different relationships are here: people have sex first, then they decide if they want a relationship. Whereas in Asia, people date first,” says Eshita Kabra-Davies in her Brown Bodies chat. And that’s just a few of the things we need to talk about. Sex impacts us all, whether we’re having it or not — not only does it affect our love lives, it plays an important role in our confidence and the way we carry ourselves in the world, our careers, our interactions with our communities, our relationships with ourselves, our parents, family, God, faith, spirituality.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Rebelling against the colonisers,17-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/17/rebelling-against-the-colonisers-sahm/,"The dastarkhan Years ago when we travelled to Pakistan, and we sat around the dastarkhan (the cloth for eating food on the floor) eating mangoes with the rest of the family, we vividly remember our grandfather, or as we called him ‘Nana’, making a passing comment about being put in solitary confinement by the British Army. At the time in our younger years, we didn’t pay it much mind because who would listen and think that wasn’t normal. Now, as Pakistani diaspora women, we wish we’d listened harder because these defining moments have left his mark on us. Nana’s defiance My grandfather passed quite suddenly over 20 years ago, at the age of 75. His death devastated us as a family because we just always thought he would be there, forever just sitting praying for us, reading fortunes and pouring into us his love and defiance. In the preceding years since his passing, whenever we would gather as a family and Nana was mentioned, we would talk about his life and the stories we know of – and the story of his defiance and incarceration by the British is one that always comes up. We’d heard the headline from Nana that at the age of 19 he went off in a stubborn and defiant rage against his family’s wishes, and joined the British army. How we remember Nana We remember our Nana as a tall, strong pathan with a white beard who spent most of his time in prayers, telling us off for staying up too late and stating that we were ‘letting the devil in’, or spending time making things like a troll’s house (when there was that whole obsession). Though in his youth, Nana was the type of fiery individual who never backed down from his point of view, he was the type of man that would go off hunting on his own in the mountains for days, or if he had pain in his tooth, ask the local “dentist/cobbler” to yank his tooth out just because he couldn’t be bothered to deal with the pain. If ever there was someone who lived their life on their own terms – he embodied it. His enigmatic presence and personality was deeply ingrained in us and his fortitude has passed through to his descendants. Our grandfather always challenged the gender norms for his era: we saw him cooking, cleaning, mending his own clothes – he was so confident in who he was that he didn’t care what others thought of him, as long as he could serve and be true in front of his Lord. Even when he’d been wronged – quite horrendously by people who were family – he never held a grudge against them, and he still met them with love and acceptance. Insolence As discussions around migration and colonialism are brought up, our mother and uncle retell the story of Nana’s jail time when Britain still ruled over what is now Pakistan. So the story goes: as a young man, and way before he was married and had six children, and most likely in his main ‘rebel without a cause’ era, he was being berated for being a ‘nobody’ and ‘good for nothing’ unlike his older brother who was a successful contractor. So off he went to show everyone who he really was and joined the British Army. As soon as he joined he was told that he was going to serve the British Army in Myanmar (then known as Burma). He refused, saying ‘how could he justify killing his own people for foreigners?’ We can imagine the look of abject horror on the face of his superior at Nana’s sheer wilful defiance as his steely, brown eyes stared them down – especially being a fair-skinned Pakistani man who was staring back at another white man – how very dare he? But my grandfather didn’t care. His service and fear was only in God – no British army, no colonel, no one could scare him to do anything that was against his moral code. So for that insolence he was carted off to solitary confinement, only being given one meal of bread and water a day. Every day, the officers came and asked if had changed his mind and would fight. Every day, he said ‘no, not today’. A part of me hopes he added ‘not today satan’. This continued for 3 months. He was immovable and nothing would change his mind. Dishonour as a badge of honour What the British army hadn’t contended with was that Nana’s older brother was a successful contractor and had built many roads, bridges and such like through army contracts. It was through these contacts that he was given reprieve from his confinement, and he was ‘dishonourably discharged’ from the army. A proud moment in our family’s history in defying his occupiers; that “dishonour” is a badge of honour and pride to us. After that stint, Nana would mock people who went off to ‘serve the King’. Our Nana’s rebellious streak has passed through to all of us – in particular the Pakistani diaspora women in the family – we have all gone against the grain. We are vocal about political and social injustices, and in challenging the existing patriarchal hegemony, which is funnily all thanks to our Nana’s resilience. by Fizza + Sadaf Qureshi",,,,,

Migrants' Rights Network,The Hostile Environment just got worse.,08-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/08/the-hostile-environment-just-got-worse/,"As part of the Government’s latest assault on migrants’ rights, they have announced a massive increase in fines and penalties to businesses found to be employing an undocumented migrant worker. Initial fines have been increased to £45,000 per worker from £20,000. These will come into effect at the start of 2024. These fines are a huge income stream for the Home Office. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, 346 civil penalties were issued to the value of £6 million. The immigration taskforce, which was announced at the beginning of the year, will launch a consultation into stronger measures aimed at deterring businesses from employing workers without permission to work¹. In response, the Shadow Immigration Minister has condemned the policy on the basis it is not tough enough, stating “strengthening penalties must be combined with stronger enforcement action if the Government is serious about tackling the problems.” From initial research at MRN, we have found that business owners from racialised and minoritised backgrounds are being targeted for immigration raids, and that in many cases, these immigration raids are conducted without appropriate warrants and within the scope of the law. It is disappointing to see the Government pushing forward with these plans whilst the Opposition calls for even tougher measures. At MRN, we know from our work on the exploitation of migrant workers and immigration enforcement in the workplace that raids are causing widespread problems and destroying communities. We stand opposed to immigration raids and the increasing demonisation of undocumented workers. Borders should not exist in everyday life, including the workplace.

We are incredibly concerned about the rise in transphobic hate and the rollback of LGBTQ+ inclusion in society.

We also know that this form of oppression intersects with race, nationality and immigration status to impact trans migrants’ sense of belonging. Solidarity is unconditional. We must stand with our trans, non-binary and gender diverse communities in their fights for rights and justice. We cannot dismantle racism without dismantling transphobia, since definitions of gender are intimately bound with White supremacy. We cannot dismantle one form of oppression without dismantling all other forms of oppression: they are interlinked and sustained by the same overarching system of power.

Migrants' Rights Network,Statement: citizenship deprivation + the “good character” requirement,31-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/31/deprivation-of-citizenship-good-character/,"Today, the Home Secretary announced new rules will come into force around deprivation of citizenship based on the “good character” requirement. We are shocked at the proposed changes to deny citizenship to anyone that has a criminal sentence of 12 months, which means that many more will be denied their social and political rights. We are also very troubled by the Home Secretary’s remark which suggested that access to free healthcare will be linked to citizenship, and we urge the Home Office to provide more details on this aspect. Despite her claims, citizenship is not a privilege, it is a fundamental right because your access to social and many political rights are linked to citizenship. MRN has seen firsthand the impact “good character” requirements have on migrants. Through our campaigning alongside the Highly Skilled Migrants , we witnessed how being denied indefinite leave to remain and being accused of “not being conducive to public good” due to “tax discrepancies”, left many destitute, without access to public funds or permission to work, and with substantial debt. We will continue to challenge the “good character” requirement and demonstrate the negative impact these changes will have. We are committed to challenging these hostile and discriminatory policies, along with the wider impact of the Hostile Environment on migrants’ lives through our lived experience and values-led campaigns .",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Inhumane Migration Bill: Open Letter,21-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/21/inhumane-migration-bill-open-letter/,"Yesterday, the inhumane Migration Bill became law. This cruel legislation will have a devastating impact on migrants and refugees. That’s why we’ve joined our friends at Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Women for Refugee Women, Just Right Scotland, Scottish Refugee Council, After Exploitation, City of Sanctuary, Refugee & Migrant Forum of Essex & London and Anti-Slavery International to say “Not in our name”. No one is illegal. We will continue to fight for the rights of everyone and ask you to show your solidarity by signing our open letter to the Prime Minister. Open Letter Dear Prime Minister, We write united in our grief, outrage, and shame at the new migration law being passed, allegedly in our name. Your new law is a cruel and inhumane attack on people who are seeking safety on our shores, and who will now be turned away in their hour of need. We all deserve to live safely, and to be supported and protected, whether we are forced to move because our home is no longer safe, or simply for a better life. This compassion is at the heart of our moral duty as a society, as well as our commitment to international law. People move – we always have, and we always will. Community and solidarity are values that bind us all together. We stand in solidarity with everyone targeted by this cruel and immoral legislation. We condemn this Government’s ongoing attacks on migrants and refuse to be complicit in the human rights violations that will result from it. We urge you to abandon this cruel project, and instead protect the rights of people seeking safety. We reject this Act, and say loudly and clearly: this hateful new law is not in our name . You can sign the open letter here .",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Trade Unions + Migrant Organisations’ Statement,20-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/20/trade-union-migrant-org-statement/,"As trade unions and migrant organisations, we stand against this Government’s attempts to pit worker against worker. We know that an injury to one is an injury to all. All workers deserve decent pay, safe working conditions and protections if our bosses seek to take advantage of us. Public sector workers deserve pay rises, but we strongly oppose any decision to fund this by further taxing migrants, by hiking visa costs and NHS fees. This is a blatant attempt to sow division within the labour movement and our communities. Increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge by 66% and increasing visa costs will push ever more people into destitution and poverty. The UK already effectively taxes migrants twice for healthcare, and has some of the most extortionate visa fees in Europe – a migrant family of four often has to pay around £50,000 over 10 years for the right to stay. This massive increase is simply unaffordable – it will price workers out of being able to afford a visa and force thousands further into poverty during the cost of living crisis, or out of the country. Migrant workers are a  vital part of our communities and our workforce. They are the backbone of our public services, and our migrant members already face the hostility of the immigration system. No worker should be pushed into poverty, unsustainable debt or homelessness simply because of the papers they hold. We urge the Government to abandon its plans to increase NHS and visa fees for migrants and meet the pay demands of our public sector workers through progressive taxation which ensures those with the broadest shoulders contribute more to our vital public services.

Migrants' Rights Network,South Asian Heritage Month,18-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/18/south-asian-heritage-month/,"This South Asian Heritage Month, we are celebrating the resilience and beauty of South Asian cultures and identities. But it is also necessary to spotlight the experiences of the most marginalised South Asian communities: such as darker-skinned South Asians, Black South Asians, Tamils, Muslims, queer South Asians, and South Asians from lower castes. South Asian diasporas in the UK have often faced racism and Islamophobia in the form of surveillance and police brutality. As anti-migrant sentiment increases in the UK, South Asians will continue to be excluded and demonised. South Asia is commonly referred to as the countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. However, we also acknowledge that there are South Asian communities with a connection to the African continent, as many South Asians are also Mauritian, Ugandan and Kenyan. As the month progresses, we will be sharing stories and reflections on the importance of South Asian Heritage Month. It is also important to bear in mind the long legacy of British colonialism in the South Asian region, and how that has defined migration to the UK and shaped experiences of diasporic belonging.

Migrants' Rights Network,The gender binary is white supremacy,14-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/14/the-gender-binary-is-white-supremacy/,"Being non-binary is about embracing my fluidity, my becoming, my journey without fixed destination . Alok V Menon We have previously spoken about how migrants, trans+ and non-binary people are all being scapegoated by the Government and society in order to distract from policy failures and austerity. An environment of hatred and hostility towards trans+ and non binary people, coupled with anti-migrant hatred, is detrimentally impacting people from the Global South who are seeking asylum in, or are moving to, the UK. For Non-Binary Awareness Week and International Non-Binary People’s Day, we wanted to write a blog on how White supremacy is foundational to the enforcement of the gender binary. But before we do this, it is important to familiarise ourselves with some definitions: Sex: a person’s sex characteristics, including their genitalia, but also chromosomes, hormones and secondary sex characteristics such as breasts and facial hair. Assigned sex at birth: when you are born, the doctor takes a look at your genitalia and decides your sex based on this fact. Intersex : a person whose sex characteristics are ambiguous or do not fit neatly into the characteristics defining male sex or female sex. Gender : someone’s conception of self. Gender binary : the idea that there are only two genders: man and woman. Cisgender person : a person whose gender identity corresponds to their assigned sex at birth. Transgender person : a person whose gender identity does not correspond to or align with their sex assigned at birth. Biological essentialism : the idea that gender is only based on someone’s assigned sex at birth. Non-binary person: a person whose gender identity does not correspond to or fit neatly with manhood or womanhood. This can include people whose gender is neither man or woman, whose gender is both man and woman, or whose gender is expansive and exists beyond the categories of man and/or woman. For more definitions, click here and here . For more information on biological sex and biological essentialism as pertains to gender, click here and here . The sex binary Before we talk about the construction of the gender binary, it is useful to speak about the construction of the sex binary. The idea that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that everyone fits neatly into either the female sex or the male sex, is demonstrably false. Intersex people exist and have always existed. Someone can have XX chromosomes and typically male genitalia, or XY chromosomes and typically female genitalia, or even XXY chromosomes, or ambiguous genitalia, or either levels of testosterone or estrogen that do not correspond to the expected amount that someone possessing their genitalia would typically have. Some people with XY chromosomes have less facial or body hair, or less testosterone, and some people with XX chromosomes may have more facial or body hair, or smaller breasts. Basically, sex is scientifically a lot more complicated than we are taught to believe, because a lot of us will fall somewhere on the spectrum, never neatly female or male, even if we do not identify as intersex ourselves. And this is because the sex binary is a White man’s creation: it was always meant to exclude communities (even White communities) that do not fit neatly into its boxes. That is why even today, BIPOC women continue to be penalised for failure to fit into categories that have no real innate importance. For example, Caster Semenya was penalised for her body’s high levels of testosterone production , yet this has no bearing on her gender identity. The history of the sex binary The construction of sex as a concept has always been rooted in White supremacy. Before the Enlightenment, sex was viewed as dualistic: “males and females were viewed as different forms of the same sex…the vagina was understood as an interior penis, the womb as a scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles” . After the Enlightenment, White males and females began to be viewed as two dichotomous and distinct sexes, with differing brains, skeletons and nervous systems, and it was these differences that justified and explained the different gender roles and social entitlements of man and woman. This White conceptualisation of sex then came to justify racism. It was argued that the greater the differentiation between males and females within a race, the higher up in the racial hierarchy that race would be. Western scientists of the time argued that in White people, the male and female sex were highly differentiated, but that in other races, males and females were not as differentiated, and therefore these races were deemed to be inferior, uncivilised and lagging behind. Sexual differentiation was seen to be a marker of civilisation that could only be accessed by White people, who they believed had “evolved” beyond primitivism. For instance, White colonisers deemed the genitalia of Black women to be animalistic and hypermasculine, and therefore indicative of savagery. The gender binary So how does the construction of sex determine the construction of gender? The gender binary, the idea that there are only two genders, man and woman, does rest considerably on the idea of the sex binary. This is because Western scientists believed that it was binary gender roles that helped White people to develop sex differentiation between males and females, and that the reason that non-White people had not developed sex differentiation, was because they did not have binary gender roles. Western scientists believed that if they imposed their idea of gender onto non-European people, they too would be able to “evolve” into a sex-differentiated race. But also, it is worthwhile remembering that Western ideas of gender also then go on to inform and maintain certain sex-based categorisations: in other words, “cultural ideas of what a man or a woman should be, dictate how we define and divide biological sex” . This means that our understanding of sex determines our understanding of gender, and vice versa. Fundamental to the White gender binary was the distinction between the private and public sphere , as informed by pseudoscience or race science. Because of their alleged different brain size, White women were deemed to be too emotional and not rational enough, and therefore their duty was to be homemakers and reproductive vessels. White men were deemed to be rational, and suited to the public sphere. Western scientists also believed that if the distinction between the public and private spheres was blurred (for instance via masculinised White women being able to vote or participate in sports), men would become feminised, and this would lead to an evolutionary regression back to primitivism (a lack of sex differentiation). And it was also believed that White men would reach their evolutionary potential through machismo and militarism, which in turn justified imperial conquest. Gender colonialism The White gender binary has been imposed onto non-Western people via continuing processes of either direct or indirect colonisation . While many pre-colonial societies surely did not approve of gender variance, in many pre-colonial societies however, gender was not binary, and there are numerous documented examples of gender variance and gender nonconformity. In many pre-colonial societies, individuals who lived outside of the binary as a “third sex” or “third gender” were often considered sacred and revered by the community, such as the Hijras of India, the Mahu of Hawaii and Tahiti, or the Two Spirit people of the “Americas”. Hijras and Two Spirit people now face demonisation. Gender for the Dagaaba tribe of Ghana, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast was assigned based on “energy”, not anatomy . Some communities also continue to recognise the existence of five genders , such as the Bugis people of Indonesia. White colonisers attributed gender non conformity and gender variance to non-European people, even to those who fit within non-European gender norms, since the appearance and social roles of non-European people did not fit within the Western gender binary. In Qajar Iran for instance, men were often beardless, while the moustache was considered to be a sign of women’s beauty . White colonisers demonised this non conformity as “savage” and “ degenerate ”, in order to justify colonialism and deny non-European people of self-governance. They then went on to criminalise this non-conformity and subject colonised people to forced assimilation into Western gender systems. Meanwhile, within Europe, queerness was demonised and blamed for “decline”: it was seen as a symptom of primitiveness that still “lingered in the white race” , and that could be eradicated via eugenics and the enforcement of the gender binary, in order to achieve the highest stage of human evolutionary development. As Alok V Menon writes, “racism is foundational to gender norms and gender norms are essential to racism. Gender is a racial construct; race is a gendered construct” . Gender liberation How do we liberate ourselves from the racist prison of gender? We have to be wary of biological determinism. Biological determinism is the idea that LGBTQ+ people are the way they are because of an innate genetic or physiological biology. Arguments for LGBTQ+ acceptance that centre on LGBTQ+ people being “born this way” or having a “trans or gay brain” actually validate the nature versus nurture binary, which has eugenic roots. But this binary is reductive, since “it’s impossible to isolate the body outside of environmental factors ”. Our anatomy, brains and identities are continuously formed in relation to environmental and social factors. This is normal. This nature versus nurture binary has also been used historically to subject queer people to horrific invasive procedures and operations in an attempt to “cure” them. As Michael Paramo writes, “binary gender rests on a faulty assumption that human souls must be limited in expressing themselves in certain manners solely based upon the fleshy structures they happen to inhabit ”. Biology is not destiny. Genitalia is not prophecy. We are far more expansive than a body . Alok V Menon Conclusion The ways we define sex and gender today are not natural or universal, but rather are intimately bound up with white supremacy. Our understandings of both sex and gender are informed by White knowledge systems that can be traced back to the colonial period. These knowledge systems demonised and attempted to erase gender variance or anything that did not fit neatly into Western understandings of sex and gender. Some Black, Indigenous and POC non binary individuals assert their gender as a rejection of these colonial legacies, but also as a defiance or interrogation of the categories of womanhood and manhood that were never designed to include them in the first place . The stories of BIPOC non binary and gender expansive people are the stories that we must be centering, since gender cannot be understood without race. We must decolonise gender if we are to defy white supremacy. The reason you do not fight for me is because you are not fighting for yourself fully…I have an unshakeable and irrevocable sense of who I am, because I am divine. I come from people who were exterminated and targetted by colonists, because the gender binary was superimposed on Black people, Indigenous people, and People of Colour by European colonists. And the reason that they targetted us is because they knew our power. So the reason that there’s so much animus against me is because of my power… I don’t think the majority of people are ready to heal, and that’s why they repress us, as trans and gender variant people, because they’ve done this violence to themselves first…They’ve repressed their own gender non-conformity. They’ve repressed their own ambivalence. They’ve repressed their own creativity. And so when they see us have the audacity to live a life without compromise… and create our own beauty, instead of saying “thank you for teaching me another way to live”, they try to disappear us, because they did that to themselves first.

Migrants' Rights Network,Disability Pride Month,06-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/06/disability-pride-month/,"Disability Pride month is a rejection of internalised shame, and an invitation to wider society to rethink the ways they define and conceptualise disabilities. It also draws attention to the very real ableism that continues to impose legal, societal and psychological barriers on Disabled communities. Disability justice involves an intersectional approach. Certain groups, such as migratised and racialised communities, are disproportionately affected by disability and by specific stigmas surrounding disability or obstacles to getting support. Sanctuary seekers are often debilitated and disabled by war and conflict, whether psychologically or physically or otherwise. Queer people, in particular QTIPOC (Queer Trans Intersex People of Colour), are disproportionately affected by mental health problems. We must think about the ways that class status intersects with, and hinders, access to adequate support and therapy. We must also consider the ways that capitalism has contributed to the prevalence of depression and anxiety, burnout and other disabilities. As someone who lives with a variety of mental health disorders, such as OCD, anxiety, body dysmorphia and dermatillomania, I haven’t always been aware of Disability Pride Month. But I think it is a necessary and beautiful thing. I have personally experienced ableist gaslighting, where I am made to feel like I am the problem, as opposed to the world around me being the problem. I have been made to feel like a burden, like I am “too much”, simply for existing, or simply for asking that I be treated with compassion. I have been made to feel ridiculous for demanding more than the bare minimum. And I have been left full of rage and disgust after seeing those who mistreated me suddenly claim to care about Disabled people. My personal experience of ableist gaslighting also informs my anti-capitalist views. Capitalism labels disabled people as economically unproductive, and so they are treated as “disposable” and unworthy of respect because of this. In our world, money always takes precedence over people’s lives, well-being and safety. And this money-obsessed mentality dictates society’s appalling treatment of Disabled people. Being a migrant from a West Asian background, I have also experienced the specific ableism that is fuelled by the “model minority” myth: the fact that we just have to keep going. That is what the older generations of my community had no choice but to do. Because of this, I have been misunderstood, and have been made to feel “lazy”, like “a failure”, or like I am overreacting. The fact that I have a disability doesn’t mean that I understand what it is like to live with a different kind of disability, and I have been ignorant towards or misunderstood other kinds of disability in the past. Even when I was younger, I had internalised ableism to the point that I was ashamed to have mental health issues, and I wanted to keep it a secret. It is so easy to internalise ableism, and then project it on to other disabled people, since we have all been brought up surrounded by it. But we can all do better, myself included! As with all social justice movements, it is a lifelong journey of commitment. Disability justice doesn’t require perfection: it requires humility, accountability, and a willingness and openness to learn from one’s mistakes. The medical model frames disability as an “issue” existing within the individual that needs to be “fixed”. Truly understanding disability involves moving away from the the very narrow medical model of disability, towards the social and holistic models of disability. For instance, some disabilities (such as mobility or sensory disabilities) can be better understood through the social model of disability. The social model of disability understands that it is society that disables people, and that the world needs to be fixed. However, many disabilities (such as dermatillomania) are better understood through the holistic model, which integrates elements of the medical and social models. Ultimately, we need to shift our understanding of disability and shift the way the world treats Disabled people and disabilities. A world where Disabled people can thrive is a world where people are respected as they are. by Anastasia Gavalas References + Resources: For more information about Disability Pride Month and the Disability Pride Flag, click here and here .

Migrants' Rights Network,How capitalism harms migrants + queer people,29-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/29/capitalism-harms-migrants-and-queer-people/,"In a previous blog post, we spoke about how the State enacts oppression against queer people and other marginalised groups. In this blog post, we will talk about how capitalism and the market subject queer people and other marginalised groups to harm. “Homocapitalism” Rahul Rao uses the term homocapitalism to describe how the market accepts “palatable” and “respectable” LGBTQ+ people, for the purposes of profit, since they are the ones with the most financial capital. The financial empowerment of White LGBTQ+ people is dependent on, and obscures, the deliberate marginalisation and suffering of racialised and migratised queer people. One example of this is the long-standing gentrification of queer spaces. “Homonecronationalism” + gentrification Elijah Edelman came up with the theory of homonecronationalism in order to explain the gentrification taking place in European cities, and how this rests on the capitalist targeting and expulsion of racialised and diasporic queer communities. Homonecronationalism explains how racialised, migratised and working-class queer people are constructed as “bad queers”, economically unproductive, or as “threats”, in order to justify their removal from neighbourhoods that are in the process of being gentrified. Queer working class diasporic community spaces that are deemed unprofitable within a capitalist system are destroyed via marginalisation, criminalisation, discrimination, destruction of public housing, police surveillance or killings, often by State institutions and corporate bodies. This then creates the space for the “good”, economically productive LGBTQ+ communities and corporates to appear, which is then used deliberately to distract from the gentrification that has taken place. In the UK context, racialised and migratised queer people are expelled from inner city areas in order to make space for gentrification. They are excluded from basic services, and their community spaces are shut down and demolished, which pushes them out of the areas in which they live and into high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. Through gentrification, areas such as Hackney, Soho and Brixton, with vibrant histories of Black radical queer communities, increasingly become sites of commercialised White gay nightlife. Aside from gentrification, the corporate appropriation of Pride also enacts harm against queer and migrant communities. Corporate appropriation of Pride Pride and the struggle for queer justice are often emptied of their radical history, and distilled into a neoliberal marketing tactic. Corporate appropriation of the queer struggle is commonly referred to as “rainbow capitalism”. Rainbow capitalism erases the anti-capitalist and anti-corporate roots and history of the queer liberation movement. It also obscures the continued harm that these corporations enact : companies release Pride and LGBTQ+ merchandise to present a queer friendly facade, and to distract from their continued exploitation of migrant workers in their supply chains. This is pinkwashing. Rainbow capitalism and pinkwashing means that consumers are buying LGBTQ+ merchandise in an attempt to be seen as allies without doing anything to tackle inequalities facing queer communities. Rainbow capitalism perpetuates the belief that individual acts of consumerism count as activism. This steers people away from engaging in actual collective radical activism that challenges the exploitation of migrant workers and other oppressive systems. Aside from depoliticising the struggle for queer liberation and presenting it as a single-issue corporate endeavour, rainbow capitalism also silences and decenters actual intersectional queer organising. Corporate support of the LGBTQ+ struggle is always performative, opportunistic and profit-driven. This shows us that inclusion is not synonymous with liberation. Inclusion into capitalism is always based on respectability, which acts to further harm marginalised queer people such as queer migrants and queer POC. We can use our understanding of rainbow capitalism to work for an intersectional politics that challenges mainstream respectability and consumerism, and that fights for the liberation of both queer people and migrants, especially those deemed economically unproductive. by Anastasia Gavalas For more information on how pinkwashing is used by states, visit the Al Qaws website here .

Migrants' Rights Network,State oppression of queer people,28-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/28/state-oppression-of-queer-people/,"The State attempts to sanitise its enduring colonial violence through its appropriation of Pride. In this blog, we will discuss the multiple ways that the UK Government enacts oppression against queer people. “Homonationalism” revisited: division At MRN, we have spoken before about homonationalism . Homonationalism is a concept proposed by Jasbir Puar which refers to the ways that “palatable” and “respectable” LGBTQ+ people and movements are accepted into the nation, in order to legitimise racist political agendas. The function of homonationalism is to ensure migratised and racialised communities end up being pitted against queer communities, which serves as a distraction from the real systems and forces that oppress queer people around the world. Homonationalism is the weaponisation of LGBTQ+ rights for the purpose of stoking hostility against migratised and racialised communities. Migratised and racialised groups are demonised and labelled as “homophobic”, in order to justify subjecting them to border violence, surveillance and hostile foreign policies. Homonationalism is not the “be all and end all” of the State’s cruelty: it is also connected to other forms of violence against queer communities. “Necropolitics”: death + distraction The concept of necropolitics was proposed by Achille Mbembe . It explains how the State is primarily and deliberately concerned with bringing about both gradual or instant death for certain populations that it deems to be “disposable”, such as racialised, migratised and homeless people. It brings about instant death through police and extrajudicial killings, whilst it brings about gradual death through withholding of basic necessities. It distracts from both of these things through displays of wealth and prosperity. We can see necropolitics in action through looking at the prosperity of European nations. The wealth of modern Europe disguises, but is also fundamentally dependent on, the centuries of colonial racial violence against, and dispossession of, the Black and Brown “Other”. “Queer necropolitics”: queer death + distraction The State’s protection and celebration of privileged LGBTQ+ people both depends on and obscures the active erasure, oppression and debilitation of racialised, migratised and working class queer people. This is what Jin Haritaworn, Adi Kuntsman, and Silvia Posocco call queer necropolitics . Those LGBTQ+ people privileged enough to be afforded some protection by the State are themselves complicit in militarism and imperialism: mainstream state-sanctioned LGBTQ+ movements are made up of the most privileged in the community, and will often perpetuate homonationalistic rhetoric. Essentially, the idea that the West must protect itself from the “homophobic” East, and that it must “save” queer people living in the Global South. Queer necropolitics can explain the ways that the British military and Metropolitan Police , both arms of the State, present themselves as “diverse” queer-friendly entities whose servicemen have attended London Pride. At the same time, they target racialised and migratised queer people at home, at the border, and abroad. The Home Office also attempts to present a “gay-friendly” facade and to pinkwash its cruelty , whilst continuing to enact detention, deportation and brutality against migratised and racialised communities. The “politics of rightful killing”: neglect While queer necropolitics exposes how racialised and migratised queer people are deemed as unworthy of protection and therefore subjected to oppression, the “ politics of rightful killing ” shows a different kind of oppression being enacted against queer people. Once the State has used queer people for its political agenda, it stops protecting them, and then neglects them to the point of death. This is what Sima Shakhsari calls the “politics of rightful killing”. We know that Europe weaponises the deaths of queer people in the Global South by framing such deaths as the result of “queerphobic” “barbaric” cultures. In doing so, Europe frames itself as the opposite: as a queer-friendly haven of freedom and rights, and uses this contrast to justify White saviourism, homonationalist civilising missions and imperial wars, which all lead to displacement. The politics of rightful killing shows us how queer asylum seekers and refugees from the Global South are conditionally deemed worthy of protection (in order to justify Western intervention in their home country), but once these sanctuary seekers reach Europe, they have served their purpose, and so the protection afforded to them is revoked, and they are neglected to the point of death. by Anastasia Gavalas References: https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/postgraduate/masters/modules/theoryfromthemargins/mbembe_22necropolitics22.pdf https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8d8e9acb38a_jin-haritaworn-queer-necropolitics-21.pdf https://static1.squarespace.com/static/550a1c94e4b0545b6579edde/t/5ad37225aa4a99046700bd88/1523806764097/Terrorist_Assemblages_Homonationalism_in_Queer_Times_Jasbir_Puar_2007.pdf?fbclid=IwAR15-Q32cPwsUqe-1gTAb6V6AViKVa6nuvOL4VH4qfBKYsKj-iNtw1Hgq48 https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/53165/1/the-gross-grim-irony-of-the-uk-home-offices-pride-rebrand https://www.gov.uk/government/news/armed-forces-on-parade-at-pride-in-london https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/07/01/pride-in-london-uniformed-met-police",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Biphobia in the UK asylum system,27-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/27/biphobia-asylum-system/,"At MRN, we want to unpack bisexuality, biphobia and the experience of queer people in the asylum system. We draw on the experiences of our team and wider Network to consider how stereotypes and biphobia are impacting people currently in the UK asylum system. Bi/M-spec¹ visibility Bisexuality is both a label and an umbrella that is distinct from lesbian and gay people. It is the term used to describe people who experience a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards more than one gender. We may describe ourselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms including bisexual, pansexual, abrosexual/fluid and queer². As bi people, we often experience a unique form of discrimination and erasure from straight people and other members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, this is often not recognised. Biphobia can manifest itself in the widespread stereotypes that bi people are “greedy” or “confused”. This can lead to exclusion from the community, community that can be incredibly vital to newly arrived queer people in the UK. Bi people, especially those in relationships with people of different genders, can be assumed to be heterosexual. Furthermore, there is an assumption that bi people possess a degree of privilege because they “can pretend to be straight”. For some bi people, this can result in imposter syndrome or feel like their experiences as queer people are not as valid as others. For bisexual asylum seekers seeking safety on the grounds of sexuality, this misconception can have damaging consequences for their asylum claims. One member of our Network told us that Home Office staff demonstrated a clear lack of understanding of bisexuality by consistently labelling them as “gay” despite them stating they were bisexual. The burden often falls on bi/m-spec asylum seekers to have to explain the nuances of their sexuality to an institution that is profoundly anti-queer. It has been widely documented that the Home Office has an ingrained ‘disbelief culture’ towards LGBTQ+ asylum seekers³. Many feel the burden of proof and are often subjected to traumatising interviews in order to demonstrate they queer. Through our Network at MRN, we have heard shocking stories of the lengths people are going to in order to meet the Home Office’s high threshold of proof including one person who provided a sex tape as part of his evidence. Queer people are already made vulnerable by our society, yet the Home Office subjects queer asylum seekers to further horrifying treatment and acts to reinforce their trauma. The Home Office does not foster a safe or inclusive environment for asylum seekers, especially for those who are bi or m-spec. It must be abolished. Misrecognition + erasure: a personal account “During my asylum claim process, I experienced the consequences of the misrecognition and erasure that often bisexual individuals face. As someone who identifies as bisexual, it was important for me to express my true self and provide accurate information about my sexual orientation. However, I soon discovered that the system’s lack of knowledge and understanding about bisexuality could have serious implications for my case. During my initial interview at the Home Office, I confidently stated that I identify as bisexual. I explained that my attraction extends to multiple genders, emphasising the significance of this aspect of my identity in seeking asylum. To my surprise, I noticed that my case file had been marked as “gay,” completely disregarding and erasing my bisexual identity. This misclassification was not an administrative oversight; it reflected the misunderstanding of bisexuality and the unique experiences that bisexual asylum seekers face. It felt as though my identity was being boxed into ‘gay’.” References: ¹Multiple-attraction spectrum. ² https://www.stonewall.org.uk/bi-hub ³ https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Women-for-Refugee-Women-See-Us-Believe-Us-Stand-With-Us.pdf",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Why Cypriots should stand in solidarity with refugees,23-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/23/cypriot-solidarity-refugees/,"This blog trace Cyprus’ history of displacement and being colonised, and explains how this should inform Cypriot solidarity towards refugees. Displacement + colonial legacies Cyprus is an island of displaced people and refugees. This displacement was brought about by decades of British divide and rule colonial policies, which turned the inhabitants of the island against each other along imagined ethnic lines . The conflict later culminated in a Greek coup and a Turkish invasion. Britain had a vested interest in Turkey’s invasion, as it would justify their continued military bases on the island and allow them to continue to use Cyprus as a strategic “Middle East” outpost for all their foreign policy invasions . Those responsible for this displacement and suffering have largely evaded accountability to this day. The pain of displacement has also been weaponised by White saviours , and by all those seeking to normalise the partition in Cyprus, through the presentation of fictitious historical narratives that place the blame on fellow Cypriot communities instead of on colonial or guarantor powers. Internally displaced persons Cypriots who fled Cyprus during the invasion would legally be considered refugees, since they have crossed an internationally recognised border. However displaced Cypriots who remained on the island would be considered internally displaced persons (IDPs). Even though displacement has occurred across the border shared between the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), the TRNC is not an internationally recognised state, and so the displacement does not involve an internationally recognised border, meaning that the criteria of refugeehood is not met. Both Cypriot refugees and IDPs are unable to return to their homes. Remembering Palestine In 1947, the UN passed its partition plan for Palestine. In 1948, with the end of the British Mandate over Palestine, Israel was created and the Nakba began. The Nakba refers to the ongoing genocide and displacement of Palestinians from Palestine by Israel, and the beginning of settler-colonialism by Israel. There are millions of Palestinian refugees worldwide, and many remain internally displaced within occupied Palestine, unable to ever return home. Whilst the end goal of the Zionist movement was always the colonisation of Palestine, Cyprus had also been considered for additional Zionist occupation, as a stepping stone towards this end goal, and several Zionist plans for the occupation of Cyprus were proposed to this nature. In 1939, a Zionist settlement plan was submitted to the then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and called for “the entire evacuation of the present population of Cyprus” . This differed to previous plans since Cyprus was being proposed as the location of settler colonialism instead of Palestine. These plans were refused. While these plans failed, they are important to remember. Cyprus is currently experiencing its own form of settler colonialism through the ongoing Turkish invasion and attempts at demographic change. But a hidden and widely forgotten part of our history shows us that our country could have now been the one subjected to Israeli occupation and all the displacement that has caused. Solidarity through remembering Cypriots generally have more social power by virtue of their skin tone, and are afforded greater proximity to Whiteness than other racialised communities, both originating inside and outside of the West Asia region, who have suffered and continue to suffer displacement. The notion of the “model minority” myth is also prevalent amongst Cypriot communities, and it is used to differentiate Cypriots from other racialised communities. This allows us to forget our roots, our history, and makes us aspire to Whiteness. We must remember our histories, and the ways we were treated, and how this has led us to where we are today. When we speak about solidarity, we mean standing with marginalised communities unconditionally. Solidarity is something that you extend to others at the expense of your own comfort, power and privilege. And solidarity is showing up for others, even if you have not experienced what they have. Yet there is something important and revolutionary about solidarity coming from one marginalised group, to another. This is because it is rooted in some kind of empathy , despite the differences between various struggles. It is a personally -informed understanding that we are all harmed and dehumanised by the same oppressive systems, by the same colonial legacies, and that our suffering is coming from the same place. Our liberation as displaced and colonised people can only come through solidarity with each other. Cypriots should not stand in solidarity with internally displaced people and refugees only because we have also experienced displacement. But since we know the pain of displacement through colonisation, and have experienced the history of our displacement and suffering being weaponised to suit different colonial and revisionist agendas, our solidarity should be instinctual . This is because our solidarity comes from empathy , and from a place of embodied understanding. Cyprus has a long history of progressive movements and solidarity with marginalised groups. One example of its empathy-informed solidarity was a letter in 1977 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN Secretary General , condemning the settler colonialism in occupied Palestine, and drawing parallels with the ongoing Turkish occupation of Cyprus. Today, both the TRNC and ROC are normalising relationships with Israel, despite our long history of displacement as Cypriots. Not all skin folk are kin folk. But they should be. Where is our empathy towards other racialised displaced people? Or have we denied our history so much that we have also lost our empathy? It is time to remember. by Anastasia Gavalas , MRN Comms Officer We should stand in solidarity with refugees first and foremost out of humanity- regardless of whether or not it is something familiar to us. Understanding something so detrimental, and offering a helping hand/spreading awareness is essential. For Cypriots, this should resonate deeper as our own displacement has been downplayed, and weaponised on the rare occasions that it is recognised. Sophia, a local Greek-speaking Cypriot The UN has had it’s longest peacekeeping mission in Cyprus. Communities have been/are displaced for decades, and there is a buffer zone dividing the island up until today. Cypriot people know pain very well. The right to self-determination, (true) independence, united communities and safety, are feelings that all of us long for, especially Cypriots. When my dad was forcibly displaced, they had to live in an underground cherry warehouse for a year, and they only got a dirty blanket that people use for covering oregano in order to cover themselves up. The struggle of being forcibly displaced from your own land is a pain that no one should experience. Solidarity looks like giving space for people who experienced displacement and adversity, both in the form of physical manifestation and emotional. It’s about listening to their voices and what they need. It’s about standing hand in hand together against arbitrary borders and making sure everyone has a safe and nurturing place with their own terms. For all of these reasons, and many many more, Cypriot people should be at the forefront when it comes to standing in solidarity with all displaced people, everywhere, as their pain is our pain. a Cypriot diaspora community member",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,"Scapegoating of migrants, Muslims + queer people: an intersectional perspective",21-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/21/scapegoating-intersectional-perspective/,"At times of domestic instability or economic hardship, demonisation of marginalised groups often increases. In the contemporary British context, the queer community, Muslims and migrants have become the latest targets of Government and right-wing scapegoating. Scapegoating and the painting of marginalised communities as “threats” are an established, and effective, distraction mechanism by those in power. Denial of racism, homophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia play a key role in scapegoating. It is used to veil the hate and discrimination that is essential in constructing the idea of a “threat” in the public consciousness. Marginalised groups are often targeted by this deflection. In the culture war that is gripping the UK, migrant groups, Muslims and the queer community have been characterised as the latest “threat” to communities and values. Characterising different marginalised groups as a “threat” is necessary for those in power to continue being in power. It is a common mechanism that states use in order to normalise the “state of exception”: where a state suspends the normal legal order by taking exceptional measures against certain communities. Measures like the inhumane Migration Bill or the Nationality and Borders Act. If there is no “threat”, there is no justification for exceptional measures to be taken. So, if a group is constructed as a “threat”, then subjecting that group to restrictive policies becomes justified in the eyes of those in power, and in the eyes of society at large. Scapegoating: refugee, migrant + migratised communities We consistently hear the argument that “it’s not racist to be worried about immigration”. We cannot ignore the fact that the characterisation of certain groups as a “threat” is inherently racialised. The racism underlying the scapegoating of migrants is constantly denied by those perpetuating that scapegoating.  Ultimately, fears around immigration stem from the fear that “Britishness” will morph into something unknown and unfamiliar. In other words, this is the racist fear of demographic change and infiltration of the ‘Other’. The language of ‘invasion’, ‘assimilation’ or ‘illegal immigrant’ demonstrates this. Now, with ‘migrant hunters’ visiting Home Office accommodation on a regular basis, we have an issue where the refugees that came to get safety are now feeling threatened and unsafe in the UK and  questioning why they came to the UK. Scapegoating of queer people: drag queens and the trans community Hateful rhetoric and scapegoating aimed at refugee and migrant communities is also being used against the queer community. In the last four years alone, anti-trans hate has skyrocketed by 156% between 2018-2022. Media and politicians alike have devoted lots of airtime to transphobic and homophobic views, with a particular emphasis on constructing the ridiculous yet harmful idea that trans women are a “threat” to cis women. Far-right demonstrations outside drag queen story times by fascist organisations like Turning Point are inherently linked to the demonstrations outside Home Office accommodation, since both are underpinned by the demonisation of marginalised communities and the attribution of social ills to the existence of these communities The intersectional relationship of queerphobia, racism and anti-migrant hate impact many communities in the UK as well as LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. It is no secret that queer asylum seekers experience systemic gaslighting and a ‘disbelief culture’ at the hands of the UK immigration system. We know from our Network that queer asylum seekers are resorting to increasingly drastic and harmful ways to prove their sexuality and/or gender identity to the Home Office. It’s time to get uncomfortable The charity and not-for-profit sector has a duty to acknowledge systems of oppression and must implement an intersectional approach in order to truly tackle injustices in society. It’s time we get comfortable having uncomfortable conversations, regardless of where we sit on the political spectrum or the work we do. That means acknowledging some uncomfortable truths that have continued to be brushed under the carpet in Britain. It’s racist to label refugees and migrants as a “threat”. It’s racist to demonstrate outside Home Office accommodation. It’s transphobic to deny trans people access to essential spaces and services. It is queerphobic to demonstrate outside drag queen storytime. Stop and unpick your prejudice. Ask yourself who is really making your life more difficult? If we are too occupied by opposing migrants and Muslims and queer people, then what is actually making your life difficult (the oppression perpetrated by the State) continues to go unchallenged.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,World Refugee Day,20-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/20/world-refugee-day/,"Forgotten refugees This World Refugee Day, we want to draw attention to the forgotten refugees of the world , including Palestinians, Sudanis, Syrians, Iraqis and those from the Global South. Refugees who are racialised and suffering the legacies of (settler) colonialism and imperialism are often neglected, and their plight is ignored by European society. We must remember the colonial causes of displacement, and centre the stories of those who are often left out of the conversation, including Muslim refugees and refugees with disabilities. At MRN, we look at migration through an intersectional lens, because we cannot understand the movement of people without an understanding of how people experience compounded forms of oppression beyond citizenship status. Queering “refugee” How do we stand in solidarity with refugees, especially during Pride Month? We must recognise the unique struggles of queer refugees, and the specific intersections of refugee status and queerness. But queer theory can also allow us to expand our understanding of who gets to even count as a refugee in the first place. If queerness is an orientation defiant of mainstream norms, definitions and ways of understanding the world , we can queer the label of “refugee”, and open this definition up to include those who are often left behind. How can we queer the label of “refugee”? Before we can expand our understanding of who counts as a refugee, we need to familiarise ourselves with what “refugee” actually means. A refugee is an individual whose claim for asylum has been legally recognised. It includes those who have been forcibly displaced from one country to another, due to war or conflict, or because they are being harmed or are at risk of being harmed due to a protected characteristic. As the label of “refugee” is used to denote a person whose asylum claim has been recognised, it excludes many who do not meet this criteria. We think it is important to include undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, and those whose claims have not been recognised through our refugee advocacy, since those who are barred from receiving the extra legal and societal protections afforded to refugees are denied this protection due to arbitrary legal thresholds and criteria. The label of “refugee” also does not commonly include those who have been internally displaced, since it is focused on those who are displaced across internationally recognised borders. However, the stories of internally displaced people also deserve our attention, despite the absence of an internationally recognised border being crossed. We must think about who gets the protection of being formally recognised as a “refugee”, and how this is reflective of racial hierarchies that denote some people as more worthy of protection and respect, and others as deserving of dehumanisation. We must think about how the legal category of “refugee” can be used to silence, dismiss and ostracise those who are deemed as “illegitimate”, “unworthy” or “ungenuine”, and how this reinforces an idea of humanity centred on Whiteness.

Migrants' Rights Network,What changes have there been to right to work guidance for employers?,06-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/06/changes-right-to-work-guidance/,"The intersection of employment and immigration rules are complex and right to work rules are confusing. Through the Challenge the Checks campaign, our coalition has found evidence of the damage this confusion is causing for migrant workers and employers. An essential part of this campaign is to explain this incredibly complex area in order to attempt to tackle the adverse effects on migrants. The guidance advises an employer how to conduct a right to work check and sets out the specific actions you can take to prevent liability for a civil penalty. This is called establishing a statutory excuse against liability for a penalty¹. Right to Work Guidance for Employers The Home Office has published guidance for employers’ Employer’s guide to right to work checks’ on how to conduct a right to work check. The first guidance was published by the Home Office on 16 February 2008, and followed by several new publications and amendments over the years. Since February 2008, the Home Office has amended the guidance at least 29 times. Each one of them remains relevant and employers must refer to them, where relevant. This makes it all extremely complicated, and the amendments and changes to the ‘Employer’s right to work checks guide’ can bring even more problems. Here we have listed some of the most important and major changes that have been made, and how they have impacted workers. Proving right to work The biggest challenge came about through the 2014 changes. If you have valid leave to remain in an expired passport, it is now not acceptable as proof of right to work.  A current and valid passport had to be used². This has meant people have had to renew their passports by applying for a biometric residence permit and pay additional fees to prove their ‘right to work’ so the employer can establish a statutory excuse. There are also cases of people being told they can no longer remain employed because their passport has expired, and have been wrongly and ‘illegally’ terminated from their jobs because of this change. Since July 2015, BRPs are the only evidence of lawful residence currently issued by the Home Office to most non-EEA nationals and their dependents granted permission to remain in the UK for more than 6 months. But in April 2022, another significant change took place with Biometric Residence Card (BRC), Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) and Frontier Worker Permit (FWP) holders. These documents have been completely removed from the list of acceptable documents. It means that employers cannot accept or check a physical BRC, BRP or FWP as proof of right to work. This is in spite of the Home Office advising employers to perform a manual ‘right to work’ check. We assume this huge and substantial change is as a result of the move to a digital status only for current and future visa/BRP holders but the Home Office never says why they make these changes and why there are so many changes in a short period of time. In the 2018 amendments, the guidance states that employers are required to use the Home Office online checking service when carrying out a right to work check in order to establish a statutory excuse. This reflects the amendment brought in by the Immigration [Restriction on Employment]. Here is the issue: one the one hand, the law says that workers who have permission to work can work, and they are not required to evidence their right to work to employers, but on the other hand, the Home Office tells the employer they have to do a right to work check either using the online checking service or via a manual check, but they cannot legally force the worker to do the right to work check. There is no legal requirement to do so. In addition, in the Employer’s guide to right to work checks, the Home Office tells workers, especially asylum seekers and British and Irish citizens, that some immigration documents issued by the Home Office are valid immigration documents which they can use to evidence their right to work, even if it is expired. However, at the same time in another bit of guidance, the Home Office tells employers that they cannot establish a statutory excuse because the same documents are not “trusted documents”. This is all the result of unnecessarily complex Home Office policy which states that while the leave itself is valid, it has to be in a current document for it to be accepted as part of a right to work check. The Home Office has not made this clear. These are just a few of the issues and contradictions that exist in the system which can have devastating impacts on migrant workers. Case study: Miss W Sims v The London Borough of Lewisham and Governing Body of Adamsrill Primary School Miss W Sims (an American national) claimed she was unfairly dismissed and experienced race discrimination in April 2018. She was asked to provide evidence of her right to work through a DBS check. She produced a number of documents including an expired American passport which contained her indefinite leave to remain (IRL) stamp. Her current passport did not contain this stamp. She had previously been told that her old passport with ILR stamp could be used as evidence and her status could not be revoked.  At this time, the DBS system would not allow them to move beyond the visa section and she did not possess a Biometric Residents Permit (BRP) at that time. The employer dismissed her because of “her inability to satisfy” the right to work check. The school’s Human Resources department also told her that the claimant and her mother were “illegal immigrants”, that her American passport was forged and that she had been “evading the authorities”. Upon dismissal in April 2018, Miss W Sims contacted the Citizens Advice Bureau on the same day and made multiple efforts to seek assistance, but was advised before any employment tribunal, she should first resolve her immigration status. This advice was made despite a three-month time limit to bring a claim. As a result, her local MP wrote to the Home Office on her behalf recommending that the fee for a biometric residency permit (BRP) be waived. Almost ten months later, she received her BRP following an application to the Windrush taskforce. Over those ten months, she suffered financial hardship and did not receive any benefits until March 2019. She noted during the trial that she was terrified immigration enforcement would arrest her for being “illegal in the country”. The Tribunal found in favour of Miss W Sims and was awarded the sum of £18,000 as compensation. ¹Home Office , Employer’s guide to rights to work checks –  each guidance starts with this sentence on the very first page ‘about the guidance’. ²These require an employer to accept only leave (For example, documents which contain an expiry date must now be current (except those showing that the holder is a British citizen, a citizen of the UK and Colonies having the right of abode, a national of an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland or their family members with permanent residence).for example Indefinite Leave to Remain). This creates a problem for those who hold an Immigration Status Document issued by the Home Office before November 2008, which was  in a current passport.",,,,,

Migrants' Rights Network,Pride must continue its revolt,01-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/01/pride-must-continue-revolt/,"The first Pride was a revolt by Black and Brown, trans and queer people against state-sanctioned racism and queerphobia. This is why police, immigration enforcement officials and any kind of oppressive institutions must not be welcomed at Pride, for the safety of Black, Brown, migratised, undocumented and queer communities. We can clearly see how migrant, racialised and queer communities are all painted as an inherent “unassimilable” “threat” to the so-called Western way of life, and how these attacks against multiple marginalised groups have come to be a defining feature of the far-right. This can perhaps embolden us to continue to build bonds between different marginalised groups, since our struggles are all intertwined . Borders will always exclude those not deemed worthy enough, whether they be queer, racialised, migratised or otherwise. This is why solidarity is so important. Our politics must be intersectional: single-issue politics are an injustice to all marginalised people. At a time when the Home Secretary has bashed the left for being “ashamed of our history” , it is worthwhile remembering which histories we should be proud of: histories of resistance by marginalised groups. But it is also worth remembering the shameful parts of our history: colonialism and its homophobic legacy . There is NO Pride in that. Racialised and migratised communities have ALWAYS been at the forefront of queer liberation. They have always resisted border violence, gentrification, police brutality and surveillance. It is imperative to remember these beautifully powerful histories of queerness, and to honour them everyday. We can do this by understanding that queerness, race and class are interconnected, and always have been. Only through intersectionality can we understand the systems of oppression that shape the way the State and society treat people seeking safety or a new life.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Migration Figures: Statement,25-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/25/migration-figures-statement/,"Today’s migration figures show 606,000 in numbers and the anti-migrant rhetoric has increased with it. We cannot and should not view people coming here to support our economies and sectors as a disposable number. The Government is driving its agenda to convince us that there are “too many migrants”- which is both inflammatory and untrue. This idea has come straight from the scapegoating playbook. Migrant communities are not a threat that needs to be dealt with. They are not a drain on the UK’s resources or public services. In fact without them, the NHS would likely have collapsed long ago. The criticism should remain focused on the Government’s austerity policies and welfare cuts, which deprive all of our communities of resources and the public services we need.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,National Conservatism Conference,24-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/24/national-conservatism-conference-statement/,"The controversial National Conservatism Conference took place last week and was essentially a showcase of everything we’re fighting at the Migrants’ Rights Network: scapegoating and a demonisation of minorities, including People of Colour and migrants. There was no shortage of inflammatory racist statements being made, including Suella showcasing her ongoing obsession with the ethnicity of grooming gangs. She had previously claimed in an interview with Sky News that grooming gang members are “almost all British-Pakistani” . She has already been called out for her offensive words, yet she continues to spin this dangerously false narrative, despite Home Office statistics showing that group-based Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) offenders are most commonly White . In stating that “nobody should be blamed for things that happened before they were born”, her words also showed a deep denial of Britain’s role in the enslavement of people from the African continent. Britain’s involvement always occurred in the colonised outposts as opposed to at home. This means it was rarely witnessed, and the UK could always pretend it wasn’t happening, distance itself from this atrocity, and shirk any responsibility for practising it. Our Government panders to White guilt by absolving White people from interrogating and reflecting on their own privilege, and sordid history. Suella stated that “those on the left are ashamed of our history”. We wonder how someone could remain so delusionally unashamed, especially when history continues to benefit those in power at the expense of racialised communities. The Conference also played into moral panic surrounding the “decline” of “Western civilisation” and “demographic change”. Not only does this reference the transphobic, homophobic and misogynist obsession with “normative families” that demonises single-parent families, but it also reveals a deeply racist anti-migrant sentiment which alludes to the Great Replacement Theory. We can clearly see how migrant, racialised and queer communities are all painted as an inherent “unassimilable” “threat” to the so-called Western way of life, and how these attacks against multiple marginalised groups have come to be a defining feature of the far-right. This can perhaps embolden us to continue to build bonds between different marginalised groups, since our struggles are all intertwined. At MRN, we look at migration and migration policies through an intersectional lens. Without this approach, we cannot truly understand the systems of oppression that shape the way the State treats people seeking safety or a new life. We have to acknowledge the role that racism and colonialism play in defining who is welcome. The Government believes that those fighting for progressive change view “the purpose of politics as to eradicate the existence of inequality, even if that comes at the expense of individual liberty and human flourishing.” We wonder why the Government is so content to fixate on “individual liberty” for the powerful few, at the expense of everyone else’s flourishing.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Asylum accommodation: what’s going on?,19-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/19/accommodation-asylum/,"The question of where to accommodate newly arrived people in the UK or people who are awaiting Home Office decisions has been a contentious one for some time. Hostility has been simmering away about the use of hotels and now seems to be at a boiling point. In March, Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, announced Government plans to “significantly reduce the number of people requiring accommodation in hotels.” As part of the reforms, the Government has said it will repurpose surplus military sites and explore the use of vessels in line with approaches taken in the Netherlands and Scotland. What will these sites look like and what will the impact be? The age of camps and floating prisons The Government has identified a few initial sites to accommodate new arrivals. These include the Northeye Residential and Training Establishment in Bexhill, the Ministry of Defence Wethersfield in Braintree, Essex, RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire and the Bibby Stockholm Vessel in Portland Port. The Government has claimed they are using vessels to accommodate people based on previous schemes in countries like the Netherlands. However, when barges have previously been used as accommodation, there was a massive health and safety breach where raw sewage leaked into their drinking water supplies. The Typhoid outbreak infected 72 people who needed immediate treatment. Source: The Evening Standard The 222-bedroom Bibby Stockholm is one such vessel and has been previously described as an ‘oppressive environment’. It is a 1970s-built barge which the Government will use to accommodate 500 male asylum seekers- double the number it was originally planned for. On 9th May 2023, it was reported that the barge had arrived in Cornwall for ‘assessment’ before being moved to the Isle of Portland, and the first group being accommodated will arrive there in June. The implementation of this vessel comes in spite of widespread opposition from all sides of the political spectrum. Here at MRN, our vehement opposition to this proposal is in relation to the conditions those accommodated there will face, and the negative impact such isolating circumstances may have on people seeking safety. The safety and wellbeing of those residing there are rarely if ever taken into consideration, and the Government is using new measures to make it easier for asylum accommodation to circumvent health and safety measures. Crammed housing The Government will introduce a temporary licensing exemption to houses of multiple occupancy (HMO) regulations for asylum seekers. In other words, landlords will be able to fill homes with large numbers of people in properties not designed to house so many people. HMO regulations were introduced to prevent properties becoming hazardous specifically in the event of fire , and we have seen the deadly and tragic results including when a young man who perished in a fire where 18 people were residing in a two-bedroom flat. In addition, the Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, recently stated that asylum seekers would be housed in the “most basic accommodation possible” and would meet the legal requirements to ensure people were not made “destitute” but “nothing more”. According to the Asylum Accommodation and Support Statement of Requirements (Schedule 2), General Accommodation requirements state that: 2.1.1 The Provider shall provide safe, habitable, fit for purpose and correctly equipped Accommodation in areas agreed with the Authority, including appropriate related services for those Service users . With the law requiring asylum accommodation to meet certain standards, Jenrick’s statement exposes the hostility towards people seeking safety and the segregated refugee system that has taken hold in the UK. Whilst the Government introduced the ‘Homes for Ukraine’ scheme and encouraged the population to open their doors to White Ukrainians, people forced to come via irregular routes from the Global South are treated with suspicion and placed into prison-like accommodation. During the week commencing 15th May 2023, Parliament is debating the issue of HMO for asylum accommodation. Local opposition: what is the real reason? Plans in Lincolnshire to turn RAF Scampton into asylum accommodation has garnered considerable criticism amongst the local community. At a public meeting this week, residents were told it would be men from Afghanistan, Libya and “them sort of areas” . Local MPs have criticised Government plans to accommodate asylum seekers in their constituencies. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh MP criticised plans around RAF Scampton while Richard Drax MP has said he will support Dorset Council if they choose to take action against the Government’s plans to put asylum seekers on a barge . Despite failed legal challenges ( in the case of RAF Scampton ), the strength of local opposition hasn’t faded. Nor is it a sentiment that is unique to the UK. If we are to understand why there is so much hostility towards accepting asylum seekers both in the UK and across Europe, we must analyse who this opposition is aimed towards. For example, when White Ukrainians arrived in the UK, many opened their homes to them. Yet when plans are made to accommodate refugees of Colour in a community, the welcome is not quite so enthusiastic. These plans to accommodate refugees and asylum seekers in unsuitable and potentially dangerous accommodation is putting their lives at risk, and they face being retraumatised. Everyone deserves to be part of a community: the Government must support people seeking sanctuary and enable them to set down roots in their new communities. However, we have reached a point where indifference and hostility towards people seeking safety has reached such intensity that we are largely content to see people put in camps or floating prisons. How can we claim to be a compassionate country when we are prepared to do things we are so quick to condemn in other parts of the world? Britain’s record on human rights has always been weak, but we are set on a worrying path that will destroy any measly claim of upholding rights and dignity.

Migrants' Rights Network,Multiculturalism and inclusion are not things to be feared,15-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/15/multiculturalism-and-inclusion/,"Multiculturalism and inclusion are not things to be feared. Yet the Home Secretary and Government’s divisive rhetoric on migration is alienating certain groups of people while failing to address systemic and structural causes of discrimination. We must remember that these are not caused by multiculturalism, but by the State. The Home Secretary’s comments at the National Conservatism Conference highlight the problems with the narrative of ‘integration’ . The subtext of this is that they expect migrants to give up important parts of their identity, language or culture in order to be accepted and worthy of rights. It reinforces the dangerous idea that migration is ultimately a threat to the perception of ‘unity’. In an increasingly hostile environment, it is important to ask how we can expect ‘integration’ when some migrants and refugees do not enjoy the same rights and privileges that others do. “As a migrant in this country, we have limited and conditional access to some fundamental rights and are then told we are not integrating enough. We are seen as economically valuable while ‘taking’ from British people.  We cannot win.”",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Immigration Acts 2014 + 2016,12-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/12/immigration-acts-anniversary/,"The Immigration Act of 2014 received Royal Assent on 14 May 2014, almost nine years ago. The Immigration Act of 2016 received Royal Assent on 12 May 2016, exactly seven years ago. On the anniversaries of these two Acts, we must reflect on their legacy, and on the history that made them possible. In 2012, Theresa May announced her plans for the Hostile Environment: to create a living hell for undocumented migrants by restricting or denying their access to basic rights and public services through the threat of removal. Many have lived in fear of, or have been subjected to forced removal as a result of the Hostile Environment. In 2014, the Immigration Act further codified hostility towards racialised and migratised communities. It is one of the main causes of the Windrush Scandal, showing Black British people that their belonging was always conditional. The Immigration Act of 2016 further extended surveillance against and restricted the rights of migratised communities. Since then, we have seen even more cruel policies being planned and enacted. The Nationality + Borders Act, the Rwanda Deportation Deal, the inhumane Migration Bill and the plans to put asylum seekers in inhumane accommodation make it imperative that we continue to stand in solidarity with migrants and refugees. These Acts are all connected by a thread of anti-immigrant, racist rhetoric. The Hostile Environment is the immediate predecessor to these laws, but it is important to remember that migratised and racialised communities have suffered at the hands of the British state long before Theresa May’s 2012 speech that ushered in the Hostile Environment. By the Government’s own admission in their Equality Impact Assessment, the Hostile Environment treats people differently on the basis of race, and disproportionately impacts People of Colour. This proves the interconnected nature of immigration control and racism.",,,,,

Migrants' Rights Network,We reject the Immigration Minister’s inflammatory remarks.,26-Apr-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/04/26/we-reject-immigration-minister-inflammatory-remarks/,"We completely reject the Immigration Minister’s divisive comments on migrants and people arriving in the UK. At a time where hostility towards refugees and migrants is growing, his remarks are irresponsible and further vindicates the far-right. The Home Secretary has now added to Jenrick’s dehumanising narrative by drawing links between migrants and refugees and “drug dealing, exploitation (and) prostitution.” The ludicrous claim that migrants have different lifestyles and values is another route to scapegoat and vilify people seeking safety.  The Immigration Minister’s comments are part of a wider problem with terms such as cohesion, integration and assimilation, which cement the idea that migrants and racialised communities have to give up important elements of their identity or culture in order to be accepted. These ideas rest on divisive and racist ideas in order to thrive. In other words, it weaponises the problematic idea of ‘us vs. them’ and incites widespread fear of the ‘Other’. The Immigration Minister’s comments insinuate that our acceptance of people is conditional and must play into the preconceived idea of what is considered to be ‘respectable’. These ideas have a historic and complex relationship with the UK’s immigration policies from the 1905 Aliens Act to the inhumane Migration Bill working its way through Parliament. Integration, cohesion and assimilation draw upon the concept of who is deemed to be welcome, and who is not. Furthermore, the use of the term cannibalise is a pointed and racist term drenched in colonial-era ideas, specifically about People of Colour. It is a racist term which draws on the colonial stereotype of people from the Global South as “savages”. Unity is only threatened when groups are pitted against each other. We call on the Immigration Minister to withdraw his inflammatory remarks.",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,The Hostile Environment goes digital,18-Apr-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/04/18/digital-hostile-environment-2/,"The Digital Hostile Environment is growing. The Government’s crackdown on the rights of migrants and refugees spans many areas of everyday life. The Immigration Minister has recently announced plans that data sharing with the financial sector will begin as the Government cracks down on so-called “illegal migrants” accessing banking services. In a Government press release, the announcement states that the Home Office will share details of disqualified people via an anti-fraud organisation. Furthermore, banks and building societies will then check personal current account holders against those details. At the Migrants’ Rights Network, migrants’ data and digital rights has been a key campaigning area for a long time. At the end of last year, Rishi Sunak announced that the policy of data sharing with banks would be resurrected. From our previous work in this area, we knew that life was about to get even harder for migrants. These checks were introduced back in 2016 under the Immigration Act but were paused in 2018 by then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid in light of the Windrush scandal. The Government claims that having access to a current account can assist those working “unlawfully” in obtaining work “illegally and securing credit”. However, we know that these plans are riddled with technical errors and could have devastating consequences on the lives of migrant communities. An independent investigation in 2016 where they discovered an error rate of 10%. They found people listed incorrectly as ‘disqualified persons’ from a sample of accounts (ICIBI, 2016). Families with different immigration statuses will be negatively impacted by this policy and having a bank account closed can have huge ramifications for someone’s ability to work, live and thrive. In addition, these plans raise the important question of who is considered to be welcome in the UK, particularly at a time where the Government is intent on restricting ways to come to the UK and constructing the idea of the ‘illegal migrant’. Along with our partners and migrant communities in our Network, we will renew our calls for these data sharing plans between the Home Office and the banking sector for the purpose of immigration enforcement to be stopped. These plans are part of the Government’s focus on deterrence rather than helping people arriving in the UK to start a new life and tackling many of the barriers that exist for them to do so.

Migrants' Rights Network,The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill harms migrants’ rights,05-Apr-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/04/05/digital-hostile-environment/,"As part of the Challenge the Checks campaign , the Migrants’ Rights Network, Migrants at Work and the Open Rights Group are investigating how the hostile environment is negatively impacting migrant workers. As part of this work, we are looking at the intersection of data and employment rights. From the Windrush scandal, which resulted in the wrongful detention and deportation of hundreds of people, to the cruel and unjust Inhumane Migration Bill which is currently making its way through Parliament, the UK Government has continually pushed inhumane policies that endanger migrants. These hostile policies have increasingly overlapped with the digital space. While building a vast digital infrastructure of surveillance and data collection across law enforcement, housing, and benefits systems, the Home Office has said that it aims to be operating a “fully digital system” for all migrants by 2024. These systems present serious risks to migrants’ privacy, data security, and access to important services. In addition, the Data Protection Act 2018 denies migrants their full data rights through the ‘immigration exemption’. This allows the Home Office and private companies to refuse requests by individuals for access to personal data held about them on the grounds that it might “prejudice the maintenance of effective immigration control”. The Open Rights Group (ORG) and the3million have taken the Government to court twice over this exemption. Recently, the High Court agreed that this exemption is incompatible with the General Data Protection Regulation. This is a significant victory in challenging the digital hostile environment that the Government is trying to create but there are further threats ahead as the UK Government attempts to weaken privacy and data protection through the Data Protection and Digital Information (DPDI) Bill. The legislation, if passed, will increase surveillance while weakening data rights. This blog sets out a few ways the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill would negatively impact migrant workers: New exemptions for ‘national security’ and ‘crime prevention’ – the Bill has added new exemptions for re-sharing data without consent that include vague purposes like “sharing data for national security” and “crime prevention”. These exemptions are likely to result in significant re-sharing of data about vulnerable groups like migrants among Government bodies and will make it much harder to challenge the Government’s retention and repurposing of data. Changing the threshold for Subject Access Requests (SARs)– SARs allow individuals to request a copy of all of the data that a business or the Government hold about them. This can include a copy of the data, how they are using it, who they are sharing it with and where they got it from. The Bill would make it easier for the Government or businesses to deny SARs by migrant workers, which is extremely concerning as SARs are a key tool for helping people track their data and understand when it has been misused. The Government has moved toward using solely digital-based proof of immigration status. However, when the Home Office decides that a person no longer has the right to be in the UK, individuals are prevented from working and accessing key services. The changes to SARs in the DPDI Bill will make it more difficult for individuals to find out what data is held about them so that they can remedy mistakes. Changes to Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) – DPIAs are an essential process within the Government and businesses where they have to systematically analyse, identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project or plan before undertaking it. DPIAs are especially important in cases where the data being processed is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Despite this, the Bill makes changes to DPIAs, reducing the requirements to conduct one before processing people’s data and removing the requirement to consult with individuals who might be impacted by the use of their data. It is critical to hear from individuals themselves about how the use of their data could negatively impact them, so this change greatly limits the effectiveness of DPIAs. A loss of proper DPIAs also makes it harder for civil society organisations to scrutinise, inform and advise on proposed automated systems before, during and after their implementation. The changes to DPIAs will particularly impact migrant workers due to the increased use of facial recognition systems and automated visa making algorithms. A host of research shows that AI technologies have serious vulnerabilities, are systemically biased, and are applied in ways that exacerbate racial inequality. Without proper safeguards, these technologies have a disproportionate impact on marginalised communities who already face increased risk of immigration stops and right to work checks. The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill will weaken the UK’s data protection infrastructure and, crucially, leave civil society and migrant workers with fewer tools with which to demand accountability. Unfettered surveillance and data sharing among Government agencies and private companies presents a real risk of the data being used to profile, manipulate and discriminate against migrants. Additionally, an environment of increased impunity for companies and Government officials will further discourage migrant workers from accessing necessary healthcare or reporting workplace abuses. While imperfect, the current UK GDPR is one of the strongest data protection laws in the world and provides many important rights. These include the right to access data being held about you, protection against solely automated decision-making, structures for corporate accountability, and limitations on the repurposing of data. These rights are essential for empowering individuals in an data ecosystem where the government and companies hold immense power. We strongly urge the Government to drop the DPDI Bill and begin again with a legislative process that centers the rights of individuals and works to ensure the most equitable and positive outcomes for society. by Abigail Burke, Policy Manager for Data Protection at the Open Rights Group",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Statement on inappropriate refugee accommodation,30-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/30/statement-inappropriate-refugee-accommodation/,"The Government’s plans to put people seeking safety in non-housing accommodation, including offshore accommodation- ships, ferries and barrages- and military accommodation, is deeply alarming.

Isolating people seeking safety from the wider community will cause a detrimental impact to their physical and mental well-being.

Migrants' Rights Network,Commonwealth Day: Our Statement,13-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/13/commonwealth-day-statement/,"The Commonwealth is an extension of the British Empire under the disguise of liberal multiculturalism. It placates us with its promises of “unity” and “equality”, whilst the wealth it purports as being universal remains concentrated in the hands of the beneficiaries of Empire. As Kojo Koram would say, it is an enduring symbol of “Uncommon Wealth” . When we speak of wealth, we do not just speak of financial or material wealth, but also the spiritual wealth and richness that we, and all people from colonised countries, have been denied. People are well aware of physical colonisation (the colonisation of territories), but what is often left understudied is the effects of colonisation on the mind. Colonialism has distorted our understanding of ourselves, our histories and our identities, has threatened elements of our culture and heritage, and has literally subjected people to intense psychological trauma through forcible displacement and conflict. At its root, colonisation is about dehumanisation, and unfortunately, these dehumanising narratives can become internalised by the people subjected to them, which has massive psychological repercussions. The Commonwealth and its empty symbolism remains a distraction from the legacies of pillaging, decimation, violent erasure and partition that the British Empire left behind. The Commonwealth does nothing to address contemporary global wealth inequities, or the psychological scars that remain across our communities and across generations. We write this statement as two individuals with heritage from “formerly” colonised, Commonwealth countries: Pakistan and Cyprus respectively. Naturally, our lived experiences will differ, as those with heritage from the Commonwealth are not homogenous. Yet our commonality remains that we have been and continue to be colonised through imperialist means, and we are still seen and treated as less than. Both our communities were dehumanised, racialised, used as pawns in British civilising missions, and both our communities continue to suffer the lasting effects of British divide and rule. We reject this call for “unity” under the terms that colonisers have set for us. We instead envision a solidarity amongst colonised Global South communities, that looks towards healing and liberation. We will never be free under coloniser frameworks or institutions, and so we must cultivate our own. by Fizza Qureshi + Anastasia Gavalas",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,What’s going on with the UK’s immigration laws?,10-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/10/whats-going-on-with-immigration-laws/,"Immigration law and asylum has been in the news a lot recently. You might be finding it hard to get your head around what’s going on, so we’ve put together this little summary to help. At the end of last year, the Prime Minister stood up in Parliament and announced his five point plan for tackling ‘small boat’ arrivals. 1.Asylum, small boats and deportations At the end of last year, the Government hinted that tougher measures for tackling arrivals by ‘small boats’ would be coming in early 2023. This week, we got a sense of what those plans will be in the form of the ‘Illegal Migration’ Bill . In a nutshell, the Government is attempting to effectively criminalise anyone who comes to the country through an irregular route, such as crossing the English Channel. In a statement, the Home Secretary said they will detain and “swiftly remove” anyone entering via these means. People will either be removed back to their country of origin if the Government deems it safe or to a “safe third country like Rwanda”. They are trying to use this new Bill to place a legal duty on the Home Secretary to remove people and reduce the number of challenges and appeals that can suspend removal. Other measures include: The creation of a new Small Boats Operational Command with over 700 new staff. Doubling of National Crime Agency (NCA) funding to tackle smuggling gangs and signed a deal with Albania to enable the return of “illegal arrivals” i.e. vulnerable people seeking safety and a new life Enabling detention without bail or judicial review within the first 28 days of detention until they can be removed Procurement of accommodation including military land to end the practice of using hotels to accommodate people arriving in the UK While the emphasis has been on small boats, this Bill will be focused on cracking down on all forms of unauthorised routes including smuggling via lorries. There are probably a few reasons why the Government is focusing so much energy on small boats. Sunak’s predecessors faced a lot of pressure from Tory MPs to tackle the issue of small boats and previous Home Secretary, Priti Patel, tried to come up with some “magic solution”. This included putting a processing centre on an isolated volcanic island in the South Atlantic before the now infamous Rwanda plan was announced. Legislation like this is doomed to fail while increasing the suffering of refugees because it places the emphasis on deterrence rather than acknowledging the real underlying issues impacting the UK’s asylum system. The majority of displaced people do not come to the UK. The majority remain in their country of origin or neighbouring countries, while those that do come to Europe claim asylum with our European neighbours. Germany, for example, takes three times the number of refugees that the UK does. What we are seeing unfold is the age-old tactic of scapegoating immigrants to distract from numerous Government policy failures such as NHS waiting times or the cost-of-living crisis. It is also placing the blame for the issues in the asylum system on the asylum seekers, rather than taking accountability for the mess they have made. The asylum backlog is more than ten times bigger than it was in 2010. There are many reasons for this including administrative problems, inadequate training, low morale and high staff turnover. 2. Immigration enforcement Alongside the Government’s new favourite “stop the boats” phrase, the Prime Minister also committed to a renewed focus on immigration enforcement. This included a pledge to boost raids on “illegal working”, hiring 200 new Immigration Enforcement staff and restarting data sharing with banks to ensure people don’t have access to bank accounts. The Home Office has launched Operation Brycem which will focus on people working without permission in the care sector. They have already started raids on care homes in spite of the fact that we have a significant shortage of labour in the health and care sector, and these raids will significantly impact the wellbeing of those needing care. At the end of January, the Government published a press release which stated there had been a 10% rise in the number of enforcement visits since 11 December 2022 totalling 1,152 raids. As hostile rhetoric and policies are becoming more embedded, community resistance is swiftly becoming the strongest form of opposition. Anti-Raids Networks and CopWatch are helping spread the word about raids happening in communities across the UK. They directly intervene with raids and try to distribute information and legal support in communities targeted by enforcement. At the Migrants’ Rights Network, we worked with allies across the sector to compile a Know Your Rights Guide which includes vital information on banking and the hostile environment, exploitation and knowing your digital rights. 3. Digital Hostile Environment Data Protection and Digital Information Bill There are additional measures being introduced by the Government  to weaken data protection rights. Our partners at the Open Rights Group are helping to lead opposition to the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill . Legislation will reduce proper oversight of data processing, jeopardise sensitive information about UK residents and create new opportunities for discrimination against marginalised groups.. Protections for workers, women, racialised groups, migrants and the LGBTQ+ community by the UK GDPR and 2018 Data Protection Act are essential to making the UK an equitable place to live. The public has shown support for more robust regulation of data-driven technologies such as protection against surveillance, unfair dismissals, data misuses by law enforcement and against the exploitation of medical conditions for commercial purposes. Digital Right to Work checks Migrants face a wealth of issues exacerbated by the digital hostile environment. Recently, there has been another update to the Right to Work checks guide produced by the Home Office. This time they have included those individuals with an outstanding, in-time application for permission to stay in the UK, or an appeal, or Administrative Review (3C leave) to have this reflected in their digital profile, and will not need to prove their right to work using the Home Office online checking service. However, we know in practice that many employers do not understand that holding Section 3c leave entitles someone to continue working in the UK. Also, this change is only reflected for those who applied after 26 January 2023, and others will have to continue to use the Home Office’s online checking service. And, we know that digital right to work checks are riddled with issues. The Government’s online checking service has been identified as holding incorrect information such as showing someone else’s status, wrongly showing someone else’s status, wrongly showing a status as pending or showing an error message. In some cases this has resulted in unfair dismissal or job offers being revoked. If you want to learn more about how these checks impact lives, please read here .

It’s racist to claim refugees are a ‘threat’ to local communities. It’s racist to tell people to ‘go back to where they came from’. It’s racist to blame a lack of local resources on people seeking sanctuary. Demonstrations outside hotels accommodating refugees are increasing. We must acknowledge the role of Islamophobia and racism in creating and sustaining anti-migrant sentiment. The majority of people in Home Office accommodation are from majority Muslim countries and are People of Colour, often from the SWANA region (South West Asia and North Africa). These communities were once painted as a ‘threat’ in order to justify colonisation, and these same narratives are now being used as a means to subject these communities to hostile immigration policies. The Government is using refugees as scapegoats for their policy failings. They are fueling the flames with inflammatory language, and offering the far-right fodder in order to incite disenfranchised working class communities to hatred. Working class communities have more in common with refugees and migrants than they do with those in power. It’s time they realised this.

Migrants' Rights Network,Britain is an expert in homonationalistic ideology,01-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/01/britain-expert-homonationalistic-ideology/,"As LGBT History Month comes to a close, we must reflect on how far we have come, and how far we have yet to go. It’s also a time to shed light on many of the issues facing LGBTQ+ people. Beyond the pinkwashing and corporate dominated Pride events, there are still many issues facing the community that don’t get the attention they need. At the Migrants’ Rights Network, we reject single issue politics and believe that migration and refugee issues should be examined through the lens of compounded identities. As a very intersectional team, we know that the structures that oppress migrants and refugees are part of the same system of oppression that leads to queerphobia and transphobia. LGBTQ+ issues have been weaponised in recent years by the State and media to justify exclusionary or aggressive policies. This is the concept of ‘homonationalism’. Homonationalism was a concept proposed by Jasbir Puar in 2007 which argues Western LGBT movements are often bound up with upholding the racist ideology of the State . Specifically, it is a method by which the State uses sexuality to legitimise counterterrorism or exclusionary measures against Muslims or People of Colour. The concept relies on Orientalist ideologies as the West as inherently progressive who must unite against ‘backwards’, ‘inherently homophobic’ groups, which in contemporary discourse usually fixates on Muslim people . Britain is an expert in homonationalistic ideology. As Queer people, it’s incredibly frustrating to see the LGBTQ+ community appropriated to further harmful immigration policies. It is also detrimental to the continued struggle for rights and equality to assume that Queer liberation has been achieved in the UK. We are absolutely not living in a Queer utopia where we coexist harmoniously with cis-hetereo people. Queer-only spaces are a necessary lifeline because they are inherently safe. Prejudice, hate and gaslighting are still rampant. LGBTQ+ people are subjected to gaslighting or stereotyping while queer asylum seekers are subjected to invasive and traumatic treatment by immigration enforcement. Many face detention and deportation. by Julia, Policy & Strategic Comms Manager at MRN",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,How Britain exported homophobia,24-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/24/homophobia-british-empire-export/,"It is arguably true that the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community, including homophobia and transphobia, has a long and painful history that is deeply rooted in the legacy of white supremacy and colonialism. The impact of British imperialism on the lives of LGBTQ+ people in their colonies is immeasurable, and its devastating effects continue to be felt to this day. It’s a little-known fact that prior to the arrival of the British colonial regime, many indigenous tribes in Africa and Asia were accepting people of same-sex intimacy and gender variance. For example, the Igbo and Yoruba tribes in Nigeria, as well as the Dagaaba people of Ghana, assigned gender later in life, not at birth. Meanwhile, the Imbangala people of Angola recognized men in women’s clothing as a cultural norm. However, the introduction of anti-gay legislation by British colonisers in India in 1861 , marked a significant turning point for the LGBTQ+ community. These laws, which were imposed on colonised territories in an attempt to set “standards of behaviour,” led to widespread discrimination and persecution, as well as marginalisation and stigmatisation. They not only undermined personal privacy and freedom but also created an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. Sadly, out of the 69 countries where homosexuality is criminalised today, 36 of them are former British colonies . Many commonwealth African nations, for instance, still hold onto the colonial-era legislation and attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community from a commonwealth country in Africa, I know firsthand the challenges we face in society, including discrimination, persecution, and marginalisation. In my country, being gay or transgender is still considered a crime, punishable by 14 years imprisonment. The societal pressure to conform to “traditional” gender roles and heteronormativity forces many LGBTQ+ individuals to hide their identities or face persecution and violence from their families and communities. Not only are we denied basic human rights, such as access to employment, healthcare and education, there is little or no protection in the law from persecution and harassment. Injustice, inhospitable hostile welcome for LGBTQ+ For many LGBTQ+ people, the only hope of escape from this persecution is to seek asylum in other countries. However, the UK’s hostile environment policies have made the asylum process a daunting and almost impossible task for many. As an LGBTQ+ asylum seeker, I know how difficult it can be to seek protection in the UK, especially given the “culture of disbelief” among decision-makers (DMs). Many LGBTQ+ asylum seekers are rejected because DMs do not consider them to be persecuted or at risk of persecution in their home country. The Home Office has even demanded “proof of sexuality” from asylum seekers, making it even more difficult for LGBTQ+ individuals to gain protection. The demand to provide ‘proof’ is hindered by the Home Office’s limited understanding of sexuality and lack of nuance. Sexuality is still largely seen by DM’s, and indeed wider society, as simply falling into ‘gay’ or ‘straight’. While it is of course traumatic and difficult for gay asylum seekers to apply for protection, a lack of knowledge and stereotypes around bisexuality, pansexuality or fluid sexuality makes it difficult to be believed. The prevailing ‘disbelief culture’ reflects a broader inhospitable environment for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. For individuals within the LGBTQ+ community who are seeking asylum, we face significant barriers to prove our sexual identity and providing the necessary evidence to support our claims. Living in secret and fearing the consequences of being outed, many LGBTQ+ people do not have the concrete evidence necessary to be granted protection. There is a contrast between having to hide your sexuality or identity in your country of origin to protect yourself, yet in the UK you have to amplify it in order to be given protection. Furthermore, the long waiting periods and inability to receive benefits, work, open bank accounts etc, places LGBTQ+ individuals seeking asylum in the UK are at risk of abuse, exploitation, and destitution. The recent introduction of the Nationality and Borders Act , which requires higher standards of evidence, has only made it more difficult for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to prove their sexuality. We must demand better treatment for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers in the UK, including more hospitable and just asylum processes that do not rely on “proof of sexuality”. This is dehumanising.  We must also support local activists in their struggle for the decriminalisation of homosexuality, in Africa and other parts of the world, and in their fight for greater legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. The struggle for equality and justice is ongoing, but with persistence and solidarity, we can create a brighter future for all members of the LGBTQ+ community.

Migrants' Rights Network,Shamima Begum: Our Statement,22-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/22/shamima-begum-our-statement/,"The news that Shamima Begum has lost her legal challenge over the decision to deprive her of British citizenship is incredibly alarming. It sets a worrying precedent in the UK, particularly for Muslim and racialised communities. It suggests ‘Britishness’ can be called into question and revoked, leaving a person stateless and without fundamental rights. Deprivation of citizenship without notice, as set out in the Nationality and Borders Act, reaffirms the concept of who is welcome in the UK and who is a threat. Since 2010, the majority of those who have been stripped of British citizenship are Muslims with South Asian, Middle Eastern or North African heritage. Shamima Begum has been characterised as the archetype of that threat despite being a victim. If we are to challenge these discriminatory immigration and security policies then we have to continue to raise awareness of divisive ideology aimed at marginalised and racialised communities in the UK. We must stand in solidarity with Muslim communities and all those affected by this law. Image: Al-Hawl Refugee Camp, Syria, where Shamima has been living.

Migrants' Rights Network,Letter to HMRC and the Home Office on alleged tax discrepancies: Nadhim Zahawi and migrants,22-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/22/tax-discrepancies-letter-to-hmrc-and-home-office/,"On 22 February 2023, we wrote to HMRC and the Home Office on behalf of a group of migrants regarding the differential treatment of public servants like Nadhim Zahawi MP and migrants in relation to alleged tax discrepancies. For the last few years, we have been working with the Highly Skilled Migrants Group and Tier 1 visa holders who have been denied indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK by the Home Office on the basis of historical self-employment ‘tax discrepancies’. Clause 322(5) was used to determine that the individuals in question were ‘undesirable’ to settle in the UK on the basis of their ‘character’ and ‘dishonesty’. The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of their conduct (individual convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322 (1C), character or associations or the fact that they represent a threat to national security. In 2019, the Migrants’ Rights Network successfully intervened on behalf of the Highly Skilled Migrants Group and Tier 1 visa holders. The judgement stated that the Secretary of State at the time believed that the discrepancies were the result of deliberate misrepresentation to either HMRC or the Home Office. However, the Tier 1 visa holders stated that the errors were the result of “carelessness” or “ignorance”, not dishonesty. Prior to the dismissal of Mr Zahawi from the Cabinet, HMRC concluded that he was “careless” rather than “deliberate” in relation to his taxes. We believe that the differential treatment of Mr Zahawi in comparison to T1GMs demonstrates a significant contradiction that is of interest to the public. If Mr Zahawi has been acquitted, then we ask why migrants are being penalised. There cannot be one rule for the wealthy and one rule for migrants. MRN-Letter-to-HMRC-Feb-2023 Download",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,Queerness and Migration,22-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/22/queerness-and-migration-event/,"On 9 March 2023, we explored the interconnections between queerness and migration, including the experiences of queer migrants and queer POC. Queerness and Migration: About this event At the Migrants’ Rights Network, we look at migration and displacement through an intersectional lens. We analyse and raise awareness of how identity impacts policy decisions towards specific groups. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent treatment of Ukrainian refugees in comparison to Afghan, Syrian or Sudanese raised questions about who is welcome in Europe and the UK. As part of our ongoing Who is Welcome event series, we want to examine specifically how border regimes impact queer people seeking safety or a better life. We discussed the unique barriers in the immigration system for queer people whilst also countering narratives of homonationalism. People from certain countries or certain religions are characterised by the media or politicians as homophobic. LGBTQ+ rights are used as a way to exclude or alienate certain groups of migrants. But migratised and racialised communities have always been at the forefront of queer resistance to oppression.

Migrants' Rights Network,Cypriot Queerness Beyond Sexuality,15-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/15/cypriot-queerness-beyond-sexuality/,"LGBT histories I am a queer second generation Cypriot migrant to the UK. For a long time, I believed that Cypriot queer history did not and could not exist. However, there are actually extensive queer Cypriot histories that I believe have been- for the most part- deliberately buried. From transgender Aphrodites, Ishtars and priestesses to the intersex figurines of the Lady of Lemba and Idol of Pomos; from Androniki’s masculine gender-expression and the public lamentation of her death to Ottoman reforms allowing private same-sex relationships; from Marika and Panagiota Hadjiyianni to Neo-Babylonian cross-dressers, Cypriot history is filled with gender and sexual subversion. We know that the erasure of these queer histories are a result of the British attempts to whitewash, civilise and Hellenize Cypriots and their identities. What does it mean to ‘queer’ migration? Migration is the movement of people across internationally recognised borders. That’s the standard definition anyway. But if we look at migration through the lens of queerness, we can reveal histories of movement not only across internationally recognised borders, but beyond them. We can honour histories of internal displacement in Cyprus, from 1960-1974, and understand them to be just as tragic and deadly as the movement across internationally recognised frontiers. As a migrant and a queer person, I exist in a doubly queer state, because the Western concept of the nation-state was never meant to include me, on account of my migration status, but also on account of my sexuality. As a diasporic Cypriot, I will always be Cypriot-adjacent. I will never feel quite Cypriot enough, no matter how hard I try. As migrants, our histories are queered because they are broken and disrupted by movement. Yet this distance from my motherland allows me privileges. I am not surrounded by checkpoints nor by the echoes of death and destruction. Queer histories beyond LGBT Cypriot history is also queer and subversive, but in ways that extend beyond the parameters of gender and sexuality. Most people today are aware of and conceptualise Cypriots as two distinct groups: Greek and Turkish. Yet these two ethnic identities were imposed on Cypriots by British colonial policies and attitudes, in order to turn them against each other as per typical divide and rule fashion. These imagined identity constructs were created with the sole purpose of fomenting conflict, in order to legitimise Britain’s colonial role as protector, peacekeeper and guarantor in a conflict that the British empire itself facilitated. Before British colonialism, working class Turkish-speaking Cypriots (TSC) and Greek-speaking Cypriots (GSC) participated in multi-communal revolts against a corrupt Orthodox Church and Ottoman administration. TSCs and GSCs saw themselves as Christians and Muslims, not as Greeks or Turks. They lived together in mixed villages, in ‘symbiosis’. This is a history that is frequently left out of any kind of mainstream educational syllabus. No mention of this multi-communal and unapologetically Cypriot history was made in any of the years I attended Greek school. For British TSCs attending Turkish schools, I imagine the situation was quite the same. The mainstream education that diaspora Cypriots receive mirrors the education provided in the ROC and TRNC. These mainland ethno-nationalisms (Greek and Turkish) are the dominant discourse underpinning Cyprus and Cypriot identity. However, our multi communal histories survive and haunt the present, despite a deliberate distortion of the past. The Cypriotist position draws on our multi communal histories in order to disseminate a vision of Cypriotness free from these colonial labels of Greek and Turk, and to reassert Cypriot as a valid identity. The Cypriotist position is actually a queer one, since it is defiant of colonial legacies. Queerness is not merely a reference to one’s non-cis or non-hetero gender or sexuality: it can be, and always was, so much more than that. Queerness is a resistive orientation, a commitment to hopeful worldmaking. It involves an intense dissatisfaction with the world as it is, and a restless desire for it to be different. In this restlessness, we can locate queerness. Queerness is about reclaiming deviance and nonconformity, and it is a rejection of the structures that kill us. Queerness is defiant of racial capitalism, imperialism, colonial logic, and all other structures of oppression that fortify our “post”-colonial bordered world. by Anastasia Gavalas for #LGBTHistoryMonth References: @cypriotess_in_distress, “A short history of sexuality and gender expression in Cyprus” (Instagram, June 2022).

Migrants' Rights Network,‘Inclusion’ celebrates who we are,02-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/02/inclusion-celebrates-who-we-are/,"‘Inclusion’ means your culture, identity and experience are accepted and valued. ‘Integration’ forces us to lose our identities. I have been in the UK since 1997. I’ve buried a lot from those early days but my experiences have shaped how I feel about the concept of integration. When I first arrived in the late 90’s, there was no restriction on the ability to work for asylum seekers. I began working in market research. My job was to work on buses and ask people questions, largely in predominantly White areas like Dagenham. The way people treated me had a huge impact on me. They made very quick assumptions about the way I looked and my accent. They asked questions like “You don’t belong here”, or “Can I see your passport?”. They didn’t accept me because they saw me as different. The emphasis on ‘integrating’ means we are expected to be part of the wider majority and forces us to lose our individual identities if they’re seen to be different. I left the job in market research when I started training to become a teacher. It was here I realised the power of replacing ‘integration’ with ‘inclusion’. Inclusion means your culture, identity and experience are accepted and valued. As a teacher, I saw the emphasis on the word ‘inclusion’ to support everyone, from those who perhaps had learning difficulties to those for whom English was not their first language, to be successful and thrive. I wish I could say I felt our attitudes had changed over 26 years, but they haven’t. Although in education I think the idea of inclusion is welcomed, the concept of integration continues to be promoted by the Home Office. People arriving in the UK are still expected to shed who they are and subscribe to the wider ‘British’ society. We are not invaders The idea of invasion has been around for a long time. I was grappling with it before Suella Braverman stood up in the House of Commons and made that horrible statement about people invading our country via the Channel. Asylum seekers have been seen as ‘invaders’ who are ‘milking the system’ for a long time. And we’ve been treated with suspicion as a result. I had been in the UK for just three months when I was stopped and searched by plain-clothed officers. It was January 1998 and it was bitterly cold. I was being supported by Hammersmith and Fulham social services at the time and they had given me a large puffer jacket with lots of pockets to wear. I was walking when three men rounded me up because they thought I looked suspicious. It was so scary and I tried to run in my state of shock. They told me that they thought I looked “like a drug dealer” in this large coat and that the only reason I could possibly have so many pockets is because I was keeping drugs in them. My English wasn’t as good back then, so when they found a £30 food voucher that social services had given me, they called up social services to check who I was. This had a profound impact on me for a long time. But despite all the negative things that shaped my early life in the UK, I have positive memories that helped me build my life here. When I was supported by social services, there was a big picture of Albert Einstein in the office. Underneath were the words “Einstein was a refugee”. That stayed with me because it made me feel that it is possible to be both a refugee and successful. – Written by a member of the MRN community This blog post is part of our Words Matter x NSW series .",,,,,
Migrants' Rights Network,The burden of explaining where you are from,28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/the-burden-of-explaining/,"The burden of explaining where you are from can be exhausting, especially if there is a complicated story behind it. “Where are you from?” I have a very complicated relationship with this question. Ultimately, my feelings on the phrase depend on the given context. I appreciate that the power dynamics of this line of questioning can be skewed.  If the conversation is between a non-migratised White person and a Person of Colour, the power dynamics can be incredibly problematic and one-sided. Sometimes when I have been asked this question, it has been asked in the format of “are you from Iran?” or “are you North African?” In some ways, I find this experience validating as an individual from the SWANA region, especially since I have often questioned whether I truly belong in this region because of a whitewashing of my history. However, this is a very unique sense of affirmation that only people from the Cypriot community may experience, especially after doubting the identities we have been fed our entire lives. The burden However, this question is also a double-edged sword for me. Even before I had questioned what I had been told about my identity, this questions would still create a jarring or uncomfortable aftereffect: “Where are you from?” “I’m Greek”. “Where in Greece are you from?” “Well I’m actually from Cyprus”. Now that I identify as Cypriot, this question becomes even more uncomfortable: “Where are you from?” “I’m from Cyprus. I am Cypriot”. “The Greek or Turkish side?” When I am asked this, I usually just respond with “the South”, simply because I do not have energy to explain that Cyprus is Cypriot, and that Greek and Turkish are identity labels imposed onto us by British colonisers. In that moment, I also don’t know if people want a history lesson. Do they want a simple answer, or the truth? I wish in these moments I could share the truth, but sometimes the burden is just too exhausting or uncomfortable, especially if the truth is provocative and shatters every single preconceived notion that the other person may hold about my community.

Migrants' Rights Network,Migration discourse is founded on colonial lies,28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/migration-discourse-colonial-lies/,"Contemporary migration discourse shows us that we don’t really live in a “post”colonial world. “Civility” Notions of “civility” are a colonial lie. When the West ignores the plight of Palestinian or Afghan refugees, in favour of those who they deem civilised (White Ukrainians), it conveniently forgets its violent and emphatically uncivilised role in creating these “fractured presents”. The British facilitated the creation of Israel and the ongoing Nakba, leading to the mass expulsion and genocide of Palestinians. Meanwhile, the CIA covertly funded the mujahideen, an armed militia group which later morphed into the Taliban. Beyond being a re-writing of history, narratives of “civility” also hurt. As someone from the Global South whose community was colonised, I recognise contemporary “civility” narratives as an extension of the colonial period: colonisers frequently used the idea that it was necessary to “civilise” and “enlighten” indigenous communities as a means of justifying their colonisation. In fact, I believe that the notion of migrants having to be “hardworking” in order to be respected is a direct attempt to counteract the coloniser viewing colonised populations as inherently “lazy”, a narrative which was also used to justify and maintain colonial conquest. Migration discourse: “Invasion” These reflections have led me to further understand how much of contemporary migratory discourse is predicated upon colonial lies. Migrants are often scapegoated by being erroneously referred to as an “invasion”, and the movement of people across borders and into the UK is weaponised to feed into a media frenzy of outrage and paranoia. However, “when my country was turned into refugees as a result of British colonialism and a decades-long plot by NATO powers for Turkey to invade, no one cared”. My country, Cyprus, is still occupied and divided to this day. So much of our population is internally displaced, and so many people hold onto their keys in the hope that one day they will be able to return to their home. It hurts to see people up in arms about border-crossings, especially when their privilege allows them to remain ignorant as to actual invasions, occupations and colonisations: events that actually are responsible for much of the migration we see today. For instance, many Cypriots moved to the UK during the 50s, when Cyprus was still a British colony. The movement continued in the 60s, during the troubling, British-backed rise of Greek and Turkish ethno-nationalisms, and continued as a result of the 1974 Turkish invasion. Migratory movement is the undoubtable symptom of British colonial legacies. Let’s start treating it as such.

Migrants' Rights Network,A story about Akrotiri + Dhekelia,28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/a-story-akrotiri-dhekelia/,"In this blog post, I share a story about the language of “expat”. In 2021, I was in my homeland, Cyprus, enjoying a night out with a friend in Agia Napa. We suddenly came across a group of White British friends, sporting t-shirts with a wide variety of slogans: “Short Lives Matter” and “Brexit Means Brexit”, among others. Given the fact that this group got their kicks out of mocking marginalised identities (they were trivialising anti-Blackness by poking fun at BLM), it was almost certain to me that they were actually avid Brexiteers, and therefore bought into the xenophobia and racism at the heart of the Brexit debate. I remember thinking to myself, “If you hate migrants so much, why did you come to Cyprus? If you hate migrants so much, why have you come to a country where so much of the population is internally displaced?” I started to think more about the aggressive presence of English people in Cyprus, whether as tourists or “expats”: British tourists who mock migrants, and by extension mock Cypriots (since a vast proportion of our community is actually diasporic or refugees), and British “expats” who settle in Cyprus, shielded by their privileged ignorance of what the UK did to Cyprus all those years ago. It’s likely that many of these tourists will later go on to settle in Cyprus when they retire, and therefore adopt the moniker of “expat”. The word “expat” troubles me. Lots of White British people who go to live in Cyprus are referred to as “expats”, yet my community is viewed as a migrant community here in the UK. As a majority POC and migrant-led organisation, MRN uses the term “migrant” in a reclamatory sense, yet we recognise that to be subjected to the label of “migrant” by the majority of Western society, is to be demonised. Why are White British people afforded the privilege of being able to move without being demonised for it? There are many White British “expats” in Cyprus, but there are also many White Brits who live in Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which are areas of Cyprus that are legally part of Britain’s Overseas Territories. These Overseas Territories are actually military bases, which are used to launch missile attacks and sustain invasions in the rest of the SWANA region. This forces Cyprus into complicity with imperialist actions. Once more, language is shown to reveal and conceal. It reveals how we, as SWANA folk, are truly seen, and it conceals and sanitises histories and legacies of invasive, colonial violence.

Migrants' Rights Network,"There are layers to our struggle, and they are all interconnected",28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/layers-to-our-struggle/,"There are layers to the migrant experience. Integration v inclusion As a first generation Japanese migrant, I don’t like the word “integration”. It is forceful, and makes me feel like I should be like people who grow up here. But I have my own experiences, and I shouldn’t have to forget who I am in order to be respected and to be allowed to stay here. I also want my children to be proud of their Japanese heritage, and I don’t want them to feel like they have to pretend to be something they are not. I have two children, aged four and two. I encourage my children to speak Japanese. My daughter’s school also respects the fact that she is learning Japanese at home, alongside English at school, and supports her with that. My daughter also loves developing her Japanese identity and she loves the culture. The Japanese community in the UK is not particularly large, but we have a group of friends who have young children, and so our families spend time together on the weekends. My daughter has Russian and Turkish friends, but also has lots of Japanese friends that she enjoys playing with.She is always excited to see her grandparents and cousins in Japan. I am more comfortable with the term “inclusion” instead, as it shows respect for and celebration of our differences. Fortunately I have not felt any negative experiences as a migrant in the UK. Migrant ‘assimilation’ in Japan My husband’s story is different from mine. He moved from China to Japan when he was eight years old, and until moving to the UK, he mainly lived in Japan. He is fluent in Japanese and is very familiar with Japanese culture. Growing up in Japan, he was treated negatively because he was a migrant, including by teachers, and he even had to change schools due to these experiences, because he felt he wasn’t being taken care of as much as the Japanese students were. He felt pressure to assimilate, to be “more Japanese” instead of Chinese. It was difficult for him to navigate his identity. Was he Japanese? Was he Chinese? Where was his home? He wanted to leave Japan because of this, and move to the UK. It seems like Japan expects or enforces the assimilation of migrants more than the UK does. He feels more comfortable in the UK, as he feels less pressure to assimilate. Especially in London where there are lots of migrant communities. Because I have a stronger sense of home than my husband, I felt more comfortable in Japan than I do in the UK. I think this is because he’s experienced  being a migrant from a young age. He has experienced more than one “home” whereas my story of being a migrant started in my adult years, and I am still adjusting to building a “home away from home”. When I learnt about my husband’s story, I was shocked. Growing up, I knew that there were big Chinese and South Korean communities in Japan, but since all my close friends were Japanese, I grew up in a non-diversified, monocultural bubble. I didn’t realise that first and second generation migrants often have negative experiences in Japan. After hearing his story, and the story of his family, I realised how closed Japanese society was. I believe that Japanese society should become open and welcoming to migrants who chose to make Japan their home. I now know that Japanese politicians and the government in general refuse to recognise the humanity and dignity of migrants, calling them “foreigners” instead of migrants. I find this word to be exclusionary and dehumanising: because the word “foreigner” is difficult to define, it can be used to exclude many people, which is dangerous. Who defines the word “foreigner” and how? Human rights violations against asylum seekers are common in Japan’s immigration detention centres. They are like prisons. The Japanese media does not try to reveal or uncover the truth , and this makes me so angry. Clearly there is a long way to go. In some ways, the situation in Japan is comparable to the situation here, or sometimes is even worse. There are layers to our struggles, and they are all interconnected I also have complicated feelings towards the term “hardworking”. It is clear that the UK’s points-based immigration system prioritises migrants who can financially “contribute” to the British economy. My visa status makes me feel uncertain and less confident, since I am a dependent of my husband, which means my status in the UK is entirely tied to his. Sometimes, this makes me feel like I am not worthy of being here. I feel like I continuously have to prove myself, and I have never felt this kind of pressure before. In Japan, I felt independent, and nobody assessed my capabilities, knowledge and experiences. I now feel like I have less ownership and power over my life. In Japan, I could do anything. Here, I cannot. I have never shared my migration experience before publicly. Sometimes I feel like it is not appropriate for me to complain about my situation, because there are people who have it worse. I am aware that my visa status affords me with certain privileges that asylum seekers and refugees do not have. I can work and study here, and can open a bank account, and I do not constantly fear deportation. I share my story not to compare or dismiss the struggles of asylum seekers, but because I believe it is important to understand the nuances of being a migrant. Migrants all have different experiences depending on their different statuses. There are layers to our struggles, and they are all interconnected.

Migrants' Rights Network,Albania: MRN + JCWI Joint Statement,15-Dec-22,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2022/12/15/albania-joint-statement/,"Amongst the many inhumane measures he announced, we are particularly troubled by the Government’s harmful rhetoric and for singling out people from Albania. We urge the Government to stop plans to “fast-track” Albanian asylum claims and deport people to Albania based on unfounded assertions that it is a so-called “safe country”. We know from the people we work in solidarity with that many claiming asylum in the UK from Albania are survivors of trafficking and modern slavery, and that any fast-tracked deportation scheme would place them at risk of re-trafficking and further harm. The Home Office’s own recent statistics also show that the majority of asylum claims made by people from Albania are granted. It is incredibly upsetting to see cross-party support for rollbacks of protections particularly around modern slavery claims. We categorically stand against plans to raise the modern slavery threshold which have the potential to put thousands at risk and keep them in exploitative conditions. This Government and their friends in the are fuelling division and hatred in order to score political points, with complete disregard for the lives, families and communities devastated by such brutal laws and policies. What we need are more and functioning safe routes for people to come to the UK, to seek refuge, to be reunited with their loved ones, and to rebuild their lives, as well as better – not weakened – protections for survivors of trafficking and modern slavery. We need to radically transform this hostile, racist system into one centred around compassion, dignity and humanity. In search of this, we stand in solidarity with Albanians and all those seeking safety and a new life. Statement by MRN + JCWI",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,Supreme Court rules plan to send refugees to Rwanda ‘unlawful’,15-Nov-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/supreme-court-rules-refugees-rwanda-unlawful,"In a victory for human rights and compassion, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Government's plan to send refugees to Rwanda is unlawful. Freedom from Torture is delighted that the Supreme Court has affirmed what caring people already knew: the UK Government’s ‘cash for humans’ deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, but it also flies in the face of the laws of this country. The stakes of this case could not have been higher. Every day in our therapy rooms we see the terror that this scheme has inflicted on survivors of torture who have come to the UK seeking sanctuary. Instead of devising inhumane policies that defy our legal and moral duties, the Government should focus on clearing the enormous asylum backlog, in which thousands of torture survivors are languishing, unable to recover or rebuild their lives. Now more than ever, we must continue to stand united against the Government’s cruel and punitive anti-refugee policies and demand an asylum system that treats people with humanity, dignity and compassion.",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,Freedom from Torture’s statement on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories,10-Nov-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/freedom-from-tortures-statement-on-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories,"Freedom from Torture is horrified at the atrocities in Gaza and Israel including mounting reports of torture by all parties since the latest hostilities commenced on 7 October. We stand in solidarity with all people grieving for loved ones, with survivors of this appalling violence, and all those affected here in the UK and around the world. We are appalled that one month on, hostages remain in captivity and that evidence of war crimes, including collective punishment, continues to grow. For more than 35 years, Freedom from Torture has borne witness to the physical and mental scars of torture and helped many thousands of survivors to rebuild their lives. We recognise and deplore the long-standing systematic use of torture by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities. There is no justification for torture. Not in retaliation, not in war, not in any circumstances. Torture destroys lives and it is never, ever permitted. There are no exceptions. Those who torture must be held accountable for their actions – always. All States have a responsibility to prevent torture, whether committed under their own authority or by others. It is imperative that when responding to these hostilities and the wider context of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the UK government upholds the rules-based international system. The principle of universality of human rights is the foundation for all human rights, including the right to be free from torture, on which all of our work as an anti-torture organisation is based. The UK government must immediately and publicly condemn violations and abuses on all sides. We call on the UK government to bring its influence to bear to ensure all parties to the conflict comply with international humanitarian and human rights laws, including the absolute prohibition of torture in all circumstances. Furthermore, the UK government should refrain from any actions or statements that could risk being interpreted as a green light for international crimes including torture. As it has done for other conflicts, the UK should work with the international community to ensure that perpetrators of serious international crimes, including torture, are brought to justice in line with international standards. Many survivors of torture with whom we work are only alive today because armed conflicts in which they were caught up were brought to a halt. The UK government should work to ensure the commitment by all sides to an effective, unconditional and immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages. In an effort to avert the ever deepening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, the government must further ensure there is safe and sustained humanitarian access for all necessary medical staff and supplies. Finally, we know from our decades of therapeutic work with survivors of torture from conflicts across the world that a durable political solution must address the complex collective inter-generational traumas across communities. We urge the UK and the wider global community to take account of this in the important peace-building work to come.",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,Bibby Stockholm: Why refugees and torture survivors shouldn’t be housed on floating prisons,21-Aug-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/bibby-stockholm-not-suitable-refugees-and-torture-survivors,"In recent months the Government has been the centre of controversy with its focus on the Bibby Stockholm, a floating barge that resembles a prison and is designed to house refugees. But accommodation schemes like barges and tents pitched on abandoned military bases are cruel and simply not fit for purpose. The Bibby Stockholm, which has been branded a ‘potential death trap’ by fire services and contained traces of potentially deadly Legionella, is far from the ‘perfectly decent accommodation’ one Minister described it as. In fact, there’s been lots of misunderstanding about how suitable accommodation like barges are for people fleeing danger and persecution. So here are four reasons why refugees and torture survivors should not be housed on floating prisons .",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,My heart aches for young women imprisoned and suffering in Iran today,08-Aug-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/30-years-ago-iran-regime-tried-to-silence-me,"Nasrin Parvaz, member of Survivors Speak OUT , writes about how the regime is using torture and imprisonment to respond to protests in Iran. In the 1980s I was imprisoned in Iran for eight years just for taking to the streets and fighting for my freedom and demanding liberty. The regime tried to silence me with torture and threats of sexual violence. My heart aches for the young women who are still being subjected to the same kind of torture that I was more than thirty years ago. On 15th March 2023, Sepideh Qolyian , one of Iran’s most prominent female activists, was re-arrested only a few hours after being released. She had already spent five years in prison. Sepideh was imprisoned in Evin Prison, one of the primary site for housing Iran’s political prisoners since 1972, kept in solitary confinement in wing 209 and threatened with rape by the prison guards . Thirty-five years ago, I was held in the very same wing, and it was used as a torture chamber. Prisoners then, just like now, were threatened with rape, and were physically and mentally abused. Some of my fellow prisoners hanged themselves with their chadors because they just couldn’t go on anymore. A chador covers the whole body except the face, and it was compulsory to wear when I was imprisoned. The regime’s excuse for the hijab law is that women should be covered. But we, Iranian women, know that we are just mere scapegoats being used to suppress an entire country. The regime has recently ramped up its use of systemic torture to frighten and silence activists since the death of 22-year-old Zhina Mahasa Amini at the hands of Iran’s abusive “morality police” in September 2022.",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,Sunak’s heartless proposal to force refugees to live on barges is a mental and physical health catastrophe waiting to happen,27-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/forcing-refugees-barges-catastrophe-health,"For survivors of torture, living on overcrowded barges like the Bibby Stockholm can have a devastating effect. In this blog, Ann Salter (Clinical Services Manager North West ) makes a case for providing adequate accommodation for refugees. Almost all of the hundreds of traumatised people I have treated have endured horrific journeys across water to reach safety, whether that’s the English Channel, the Aegean Sea or the Mediterranean Sea. These crossings are almost always traumatic – the vessels aren’t seaworthy, those on board typically can’t swim, or there aren’t enough lifejackets. People who’ve made these crossings may also have seen fellow travellers drown. But now, Rishi Sunak’s heartless and unworkable proposal will see refugees, including survivors of torture, crammed onto floating detention centres on the sea. For many of these people, being on the water will inevitably lead to re-traumatisation. I can state without a doubt that the use of barges as sites to house refugees who have fled war and torture is totally inappropriate. Conditions are bound to be cramped and overcrowded and may be reminiscent of the places of detention in which they were tortured, which can lead to re-triggering of the trauma. Every day we speak to survivors in our therapy rooms who describe the horror, isolation and hopelessness that they feel from being housed in these kinds of dangerous accommodations. I can’t stress enough how this is a mental and physical health catastrophe waiting to happen. At Freedom from Torture, we help survivors who are experiencing the debilitating symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to develop coping strategies to help manage their symptoms. Survivors and refugees who have experience of flashbacks talk of how just being able to go outside is vital in supporting their mental health and recovery. We know that being part of a local community or being able to attend services at churches or mosques, go to English lessons, and access therapy services like ours, are essential. People can recover from their trauma and cope with their symptoms by having agency over their own lives, things like just being able to leave the house whenever they want. Something that we all take for granted every single day will not be freely available to the people housed on these barges.",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,'Illegal Migration' Act - Everything you need to know,18-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/illegal-migration-act-everything-you-need-to-know,"The Refugee Ban Bill – officially known as the ‘Illegal Migration Bill’ – is the Government’s latest inhumane and cruel attempt to strip away the basic rights of torture survivors and refugees. Read below for everything you need to know about the new law. What is the Illegal Migration Bill? The Refugee Ban Bill was announced by the Government on 7 March 2023, before becoming an Act on 20 July 2023. It's the latest piece of legislation targeting the rights of refugees and torture survivors. It effectively bans the right to seek asylum in the UK. The purpose of the Bill is to deter refugees from seeking safety in the UK . It does this by punishing people who take ‘irregular’ journeys to the UK, such as arriving via small boat, stowing away in a lorry, or flying into the UK without a legitimate visa. It places a duty on the Home Secretary to oversee the removal of anyone who enters the UK outside of normal immigration laws or has travelled through a ‘safe third country’ – even if they’re fleeing persecution or torture. Most people seeking asylum have little choice but to take dangerous journeys and don’t have the option to use the Government’s so-called ‘safe and legal routes’. Internationally, less than 1% of the world’s refugees can access resettlement schemes run by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). No refugee visa exists for people who need to quickly leave their country and airlines get fined if they allow refugees to travel to the UK without valid visas. Historically, when a country becomes unsafe and begins to produce refugees, the UK will start denying those nationals visas that would allow people to access planes and arrive in the UK quickly and safely as a means of seeking safety (applying for asylum) – this happened at the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2015. Much of the Refugee Ban Bill – which the Archbishop of Canterbury described as ‘morally unacceptable and politically impractical’ – not only contradicts the UK’s commitments to international law, but it also erodes the UK’s reputation as a leader in refugee protection . At Freedom from Torture we call it the ‘Refugee Ban Bill’ simply because it’s a piece of anti-refugee legislation. It effectively extinguishes the UK’s asylum system. It is unfair, inhumane and unlawful .",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,Refugee Ban Bill will effectively extinguish the right to seek asylum in the UK,13-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/refugee-ban-bill-will-effectively-extinguish-the-right-to-seek-asylum-in-the-uk,"The law firm Leigh Day, on behalf of Freedom from Torture, has examined the proposed 'Illegal Migration Bill'. It says that the Bill will effectively extinguish the right to seek asylum in the UK. Key aspects of the Bill are incompatible with the UK’s international obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugee Convention), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the European Convention Against Trafficking (ECAT), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CRC), say Counsel instructed by law firm Leigh Day. They add that the Bill seeks to undermine long-established domestic safeguards against arbitrary detention and to significantly curtail the courts’ constitutional role as an independent check on the lawfulness of executive action. Raza Husain KC and Eleanor Mitchell of Matrix Chambers and Jason Pobjoy, George Molyneaux and Antonia Eklund of Blackstone Chambers took instruction from Leigh Day partner, Tessa Gregory and solicitor Carolin Ott, who represented Freedom from Torture in our successful challenge to the Home Office policy of turning back migrant boats in the English Channel. The 'Illegal Migration Bill' has faced staunch opposition in the House of Lords with the Lords proposing numerous important amendments including a key amendment to clause 1 of the Bill to make clear the Government intends to act compatibly with its international obligations. Whilst the Government has made some concessions including on the Bill’s retrospective application, and the retention of existing limits on the detention of unaccompanied children and pregnant women, it has sought to overturn the majority of the amendments agreed during the Lords stages of the Bill. In its current form the Bill will: Remove people who enter the UK by irregular routes to their home country, or a safe third country, such as Rwanda Remove the right to modern slavery protections Ignore human rights claims made by asylum seekers Extend powers of detention By blocking access to asylum in the UK without any guarantee that it will be made accessible elsewhere, the UK is renouncing its commitment to international refugee protection, says the legal team. These concerns were echoed in the House of Lords where the Government’s commitment to adhering to its international obligations was repeatedly questioned. The entire regime penalises unlawful arrivals and so breaches Article 31 of the Refugee Convention which protects refugees who arrive a country of refuge by unlawful means. The Bill sets a low threshold for a country to be treated as generally safe for removal and makes it extremely difficult to mount individual challenges to removal to the countries treated as generally safe. It creates a serious risk of a failure to implement Refugee Convention obligations in good faith by knowingly transferring asylum-seekers to countries which will not respect their rights under the Convention. The Bill allows removal to designated states irrespective of whether, generally or in relation to the individual, they will respect the Refugee Convention, and indeed even if it is clear that they will not do so. The Bill provides for only two types of claim to suspend or prevent removal. There is a high risk of procedural unfairness when trying to make such claims, especially because of very tight deadlines for submitting claims and appeals, which risk creating insurmountable barriers to accessing lawyers and the courts. In breach of Article 34 of the Refugee Convention, rather than making a good-faith effort to help refugees meet the requirements for citizenship, the Bill would place them in a state of limbo and impose permanent barriers to settling lawfully in the UK and becoming British citizens. Courts have made clear that leaving people in a state of immigration limbo will eventually breach Article 8 ECHR, the right to respect for private and family life. The Bill also breaches Articles 10 and 13 of the European Convention Against Trafficking (ECAT) by allowing potential victims of trafficking to be stripped of support and removed. The Bill creates serious risks of removal contrary to Article 4 ECHR and to Article 16 ECAT, which requires that victims of trafficking be returned only with “due regard for rights, safety and dignity”. It also risks breaching the UK’s duty under Article 4 ECHR to take steps to protect potential or confirmed victims from a real/present/continuing risk of re-trafficking. Further, the Bill creates a risk that victims of trafficking will be removed from the UK before they are even given an opportunity to cooperate with the authorities, thwarting the UK’s ability to identify and prosecute people traffickers. The legal team also highlight concerns about the treatment of children under the Bill. They say limitations on the powers to remove children are insufficient and the power to defer the removal of unaccompanied children is also problematic as it leaves the child in limbo, contrary to the need for continuity in the child’s upbringing under Article 20 CRC.

Freedom from Torture,Where does torture happen around the world?,12-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/where-does-torture-happen-around-the-world,"The use of torture is completely prohibited by international law. However, many countries still employ torture methods. Read our guide below to learn about the situations in countries many of our clients are coming from. What is the UN Convention Against Torture?

Freedom from Torture,What is torture?,12-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/what-is-torture,"Torture is when someone deliberately inflicts mental or physical pain on another person for a specific purpose, where the state is involved or is unable or unwilling to prevent it. Torture is still used by governments, security forces and police, and rebel or insurgent groups across the world to silence and control. Read about how torture is defined, where torture happens around the world, why people are still being tortured, and how we work with torture survivors to rebuild their lives. How is torture defined? The definition of torture put forward by the United Nations Convention against Torture (UNCAT) is the internationally agreed definition of torture. UNCAT is the key international human rights treaty that prohibits torture under any circumstances. As of June 2023, 173 States have agreed to be legally bound by the obligations of the treaty. However, because torture is absolutely prohibited under customary international law, all States across the world are obligated to protect people under their jurisdiction from torture regardless of whether they have signed up to UNCAT. Torture is defined by UNCAT as any act where severe physical or mental pain and suffering is intentionally inflicted: to obtain information or a confession from someone as punishment for something someone has done or is suspected to have done to intimidate or coerce someone for reasons based on discrimination. According to the UNCAT definition of torture, these acts are carried out by a public official/s or a person, or people, acting in an official capacity, or with their knowledge and acceptance. This does not necessarily mean that torture is only recognised or acknowledged when it is carried out by State actors, or a person, people or group acting with the State. For example, the European Court of Human Rights says that States have a responsibility not only to not torture people under their jurisdiction, but also to protect them from torture by State and non-state, or private actors.",,,,,
Freedom from Torture,Plan to send refugees to Rwanda ‘unlawful’ – A vital win as the Court of Appeal rules on the Government’s plan,29-Jun-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/plan-to-send-refugees-to-rwanda-unlawful,"In a huge win for human rights and compassion, today the Court of Appeal ruled that the Government’s plan to send refugees to Rwanda is unlawful. We are delighted that the appeal verdict has affirmed what the caring people of this country already knew: the UK Government’s ‘cash for humans’ deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, it flies in the face of the laws of this country. Freedom from Torture provided evidence and expertise to the Court demonstrating that survivors of torture will struggle to disclose their harrowing experiences in a process that moves at breakneck speed – and with few safeguards to ensure they can challenge their removal. As the Government makes plans for its next steps, with the possibility of taking the case to the Supreme Court, we will continue to campaign for a UK that welcomes refugees and supports survivors of torture in their healing journey. We've already shown that people power works. Now, with so many depending on us, it's time to win again. With the Refugee Ban Bill still passing through parliament, we need to keep up the fight. That’s why we’re asking you to write to your MP and call on them to oppose this cruel Bill. Sonya Sceats, Chief Executive of Freedom from Torture, said: “Every day in Freedom from Torture’s therapy rooms, torture survivors confide in our clinicians their fears this expulsion scheme has generated amongst people seeking safety in this country. As we outlined in our intervention in the Court of Appeal, this dirty deal with Rwanda does too little to identify and protect survivors and other vulnerable groups and would see them placed at risk of further harm. “Sunak’s inhumane policy has sparked anger across the UK, from protesters on the streets to faith leaders and cultural icons.

Rainbow Migration,Stop the Rwanda Bill!,11-Dec-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/stop-the-rwanda-bill/,"Despite being found unlawful by the Supreme Court, this government still wants to go ahead with its plan to send people seeking safety here more than 4,000 miles away. The new Rwanda Bill is dangerous and disgraceful and cannot be passed by Parliament. Email your MP to call on them to vote against this cruel Bill. We all want to live in a society where everyone is treated with care and respect. But this government is trying to divide us in an attempt to weaken our rights and freedoms and prevent us from holding them accountable for their actions. Its Rwanda Bill will strip human rights away from people who come to the UK in the hope of safety for them and their loved ones. If this bill goes ahead, LGBTQI+ people who come to the UK seeking protection could also be sent to Rwanda.We have repeatedly warnedthat Rwanda is a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. TheUK government’s own websitestates that LGBT people in Rwanda are abused, including by local authorities. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that people have sought asylum in the UK based on their sexual orientation. People who arrive in the UK seeking asylum have fled persecution or conflict, and sending them 4,000 miles away to a place where they have no connections will only cause them further suffering. As Innocent, a gay man who grew up in Rwanda and experienced first-hand abuse, said: “The UK government should reflect more on its policy, hear out and take into account the public sentiment and what the civil society and other people representing vulnerable groups are saying. Most people seeking protection are fleeing for their lives and they need help, not punishment. I do hope that LGBTQIA+ people seeking safety will not be sent to Rwanda to face discrimination.” We will not be divided. Email your MP today to stop the Rwanda Bill.

Rainbow Migration,“I will have to hide my identity in my own room”,01-Dec-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/i-will-have-to-hide-my-identity-in-my-own-room/,"LGBTQI+ people come to the UK fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries and hoping to rebuild their lives in safety here. However, this government continues to place them in inappropriate and unsafe shared asylum accommodationwhile they wait for months or even years for an asylum decision. In shared accommodation, LGBTQI+ people are often subject to abuse and mistreatment, which can further traumatise people who are seeking safety and protection. We have documented many concerns about room-sharing for LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. In our experience, sharing a bedroom can be particularly dangerous for LGBTQI+ people. We have sadly received distressed calls from our service users, reporting incidents of abuse and harassment in shared rooms. A trans man who had been attacked back home, was placed in shared accommodation where he woke up to find some of the men he was sharing the space with were stripping off his clothes.As reported in The Guardian, he said: “The hotel staff blocked my room card [because I refused to stay in the room, but] they said I had to share. I could not do it. I slept outside the room on the stairs and cried all night. It was the worst night of my life since I arrived in the UK.” Eventually he was put on a single room. Another lesbian that we support, told the Guardian she had been forced to sign a document agreeing to room share and was terrified of what might happen to her. She said: “I will have to hide my identity in my own room. So many of us are dealing with mental health issues and trying to overcome trauma but the letter I signed said I do not have the right to object to room sharing.” This government should ensure LGBTQI+ people are accommodated suitably and safeguarded from harm while they seek to rebuild their lives in safety here.

The Rwanda plan was always cruel and immoral. We urge the Government to immediately abandon such plans with Rwanda or with any other country, and instead protect the rights of people who have come to our country in search of sanctuary. While we welcome the decision today, we remain concerned by this Government’s overall treatment of people who move to this country. We are alarmed by this Government’s continuous efforts to detain and forcibly send people to countries where they may not know anyone, especially if it puts them at risk of harm and human rights violations. We know that as a community we are compassionate and welcoming, and we need immigration policies that are rooted in that same care, compassion, and respect for human rights. We call on everyone to stand up for the rights of people seeking sanctuary, regardless of where they come from or how they travel here.

Rainbow Migration,Joint Statement: LGBTQI+ people seeking safety here will not be sent to Rwanda,15-Nov-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/joint-statement-lgbtqi-people-seeking-safety-here-will-not-be-sent-to-rwanda/,"Joint statement: Rainbow Migration andMicro Rainbow We are ecstatic that this government’s cruel plan to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda has been found unlawful by the Supreme Court. This is a huge victory for kindness and common decency. “This is a day for national celebration. The judges at the UK’s highest court have stopped this trade in humans and many people in the UK who have fled unimaginable horrors can breathe a sigh of relief”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration. “Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s commitment to pushing ahead with the Rwanda plan risked turning the UK into a country famous for its cruel policies and attitudes towards people who need safety. We, and everyone we work with, are very happy that it has finally been found unlawful. Our beneficiaries can take a breath of relief, but they are still not safe.  Now is the time to build a humane and dignified immigration system that we can all be proud of”. Sebastian Rocca, Micro Rainbow CEO For many months since it was first announced back in April 2022, we have repeatedly warned that Rwanda is a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. The UK government’s own website states that LGBT people in Rwanda are abused, including by local authorities. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that people have sought asylum in the UK based on their sexual orientation. There iswidespread evidenceof ill-treatment and abuse faced by LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda – It’s extremely concerning that this government is willing to send LGBTQI+ people who have fled life-threatening situations in their home countries and sought safety and protection in the UK to another country where they would be in danger. Innocent Uwimana, a gay man who grew up in Rwanda and came to the UK twenty years agowroteabout his struggles back home: “Growing up, I got bullied a lot because I was gay, the bullying spilled over into violence; I was terrified of going to school. When I started secondary school, it was even worse. I was physically abused by other students because they perceived me as gay. Having experienced the discrimination faced by LGBTQI+ people, I am shocked that the UK would deport people from our community there”. Innocent alsotalked to LGBTQI+ activistsbased in Rwanda, who expressed their surprise and disbelief in hearing about the UK government’s plan: “Most LGBTQI+ people want to leave Rwanda. They want to live in a place where they can be free and themselves. So why would the UK government think it is safe to send LGBTQI+ people there?” LGBTQI+ people could still be sent to other unsafe countries This decision also means that the government has nowhere to systematically send people seeking asylum to, as this government currently has no other return agreements with other countries. However, the recently passed Illegal Migration Actlists other countrieswhere people could be sent to have their claims processed. Many of these so-called ‘safe’ countries are dangerous for LGBTQI+ people. This list includes Ghana as deemed safe for men, but in 2021 nine people from Ghana were granted refugee status in the UK based on their sexual orientation. A year ago, Adams, a bisexual man from Ghana that Rainbow Migration supported was granted asylum. He was violently attacked in the street on several occasions. When he got to the UK, he got the news that his partner had been killed back home. Last week, this government announced it wanted to addIndiato the list of countries deemed safe. However in 2022, thirteen people from India were granted asylum in the UK *based on their sexual orientation.Nisha, a trans woman from India had to escape from India after her parents locked her in the house and forced her to undergo conversion practices. The Illegal Migration Act also makes it significantly more likely that LGBTQI+ people who come here will be detained, with fewer safeguards and for a minimum of 28 days. With the announcement of a new Home Secretary, it’s time for a change of direction: We call on this government to get in line with public sentiment, to ditch their heartless asylum policies and to create a more humane and compassionate asylum system so that people can rebuild their lives in safety.    *The experimental statistics show the number of asylum claims where sexual orientation was raised as a basis, or part of the basis, of the claim Disclaimer The content of this website is provided for general information only and should not be relied on as legal advice.

Rainbow Migration,LGBTQI+ people shouldn’t be moved to a floating prison,20-Oct-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/lgbtqi-people-shouldnt-be-moved-to-a-floating-prison/,"As this governmentstarts moving people seeking protection back to a floating prisonwe say it loud and clearagain: Housing people in prison-like conditions is cruel and risks further traumatising people who have had to flee unimaginable dangers and life-threatening situations. Some of the LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum that we support have already started receiving letters confirming their move in the coming days, which is extremely concerning. We know that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are particularly at risk of harm and can face serious issues when forced to live in overcrowded conditions. People will have limited access to support and they will also not be free to move around the port, so conditions on the barge are very similar to being in prison or immigration detention. In detention, LGBTQI+ people are likely to experience discrimination and harassmentfrom other people who can hold LGBTQI-phobic views. Trans people can be at even greater risk of abuse. The people that we work with are worried about being moved to the barge, and are feeling extremely anxious about this possibility and the impact it would have on them.We ask that this government commits to housing LGBTQI+ people in suitable accommodation in the community and safeguarded from harm while they seek to rebuild their lives in safety here.

Rainbow Migration,Enough: Trans people are people too,06-Oct-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/enough-trans-people-are-people-too/,"We have come together with LGBTQI+ organisations and allies across the country to say enough! Trans people are people too. Full statement fromLGBT Consortium: We cannot allow our communities, particularly our Trans and Intersex communities, to be attacked in such inhumane and degrading ways as we have seen during the Conservative Party Conference over the last week. Rather than focusing on pressing issues affecting everyone, such as the cost of living, the climate crisis or getting timely healthcare, senior Government ministers, including the Prime Minister, sought to denigrate Trans and Intersex people, and increase the barriers they already face to accessing essential services and support. We are deeply concerned at the nature and tone of these remarks and policies. Everyone has a right to live with dignity, free from discrimination and abuse, and to play an integral part in their local communities. That is the principle behind the Equality Act, which up until now has been supported by all parties. Government’s responsibility is to all its citizens and it should be working to proactively tackle life-limiting inequalities so that Trans people are safe to live their lives, respected and valued in society, and supported to thrive in what they do. However, Trans and Intersex people and communities are being let down by a Government that wants to deny their existence and their safety. For far too long now, we have seen Trans people and communities used in a culture war, mocked by those who are in positions of power, and inaccurately portrayed as a threat to others. People who support Trans people as friends, colleagues and family members are called ‘bullies’, and those questioning the Government’s new narrative in this area are removed from conversations. Announcements like the exclusion of Trans men and women from single-sex wards are made despite the NHS reporting no evidence of abuse by Trans people, and quite possibly with no consultation with those involved in providing or receiving those services. This suggests to the wider public that it is legitimate and appropriate to undertake harassment of Trans people and communities. We call upon LGBT+ people, friends, allies, family members, businesses and voluntary sector organisations to stand up and say enough. Enough of erasing and attacking some of the most marginalised people and communities in our society, and putting the health, safety and lives of Trans people at risk. Trans people, and all LGBT+ people, are an asset to our country. Reducing inequalities should be our collective goal. If the Government can target one group of innocent people, and block them from necessary services, then it can do the same to anyone else.

Rainbow Migration,Letter to the PM: Respect the lives of LGBTQI+ people and women seeking asylum in the UK,04-Oct-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/letter-to-the-pm-respect-the-lives-of-lgbtqi-people-and-women-seeking-asylum-in-the-uk/,"Together with 245 other organisations, we’ve joinedStonewallin a powerful display of solidarity, followingcomments by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, last week. The coalition, including organisations such asAmnesty,Oxfam,End Violence Against Women Coalition,Refugee CouncilandWomen For Refugee Women, has written to UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, to reaffirm the UK’s commitment to protecting LGBTQI+ people and women around the world. Many of the signatories work daily with LGBTQI+ and women refugees, and ‘bear witness to their scars from being persecuted’. The letter rejects Suella Braverman’s claim that LGBTQI+ people and women are misusing their identities to make false claims, and speaks of regret that the  Home Secretary’s selective use of stats that ‘have nothing to do with genuine concern or respect for international law, refugees or their protection.’ Robbie de Santos, Director of External Affairs at Stonewall, said:“We all deserve a government with the compassion and will to protect the most vulnerable in society. Not only is the incumbent UK Government failing LGBTQ+ people domestically, with inaction on rising hate crime, but they are also failing the international community by indicated their disdain for international law – in the process bringing great shame on party and country.” Steve Valdez-Symonds, Refugee and Migrant Rights Director at Amnesty International UK, said:“The Home Secretary’s verbal attack on the rights of LGBTQ+ and women refugees is deplorable. Not only did she once again stir utterly false prejudices against people seeking asylum, she also targeted refugees who often continue to face grave insecurity, hostility and violence – even long after escaping persecution and conflict. Ministers must stop their constant scapegoating and put their energy into repairing the utter wreckage they have made of the asylum system.” Alphonsine Kabagado, Director, Women For Refugee Women, said:“We strongly condemn Suella Braverman’s speech last week – which was dangerous, inflammatory and racist. Not only did her claims stoke hatred and fear, they were untrue. To be granted asylum in the UK, you must prove a well-founded fear of persecution. Her suggestion that people lie about their identities to make false claims for protection, or that it is possible to be granted asylum based on discrimination alone, is unfounded. We know from our work supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women, including LGBTQ+ women, that many face persecution including torture, gender-based violence, sexual violence, trafficking and rape. Braverman’s speech was also hypocritical. The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to tackling violence against women and supporting survivors of such violence, as well as to supporting LGBTQ+ people. Yet when it comes to women or LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum in the UK, it seems these commitments do not apply. Instead of whipping up hatred, fear, and division against women and LGBTQ+ people seeking safety, the Government should treat them with compassion and kindness. How we treat people is who we are; the Government’s hostility does not represent us.” Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said:“Turning our backs on LGBTQ+ people and suggesting they are undeserving of a fair hearing in the asylum system is immoral. Of the small number of people who come to the UK claiming asylum based on their sexual orientation, the majority are recognised as having a well-founded fear of persecution and are given refugee protection. We know from our work how traumatised they often are – what they need is support to restart their lives in safety, rather than hostility and disbelief. The Refugee Convention’s fundamental purpose is to offer protection to those who need it, based on shared global values of humanity and fairness. Abandoning these values does not reflect who we are as a country.” Leila Zadeh, CEO, Rainbow Migration, said:“Across the world there are LGBTQI+ people experiencing violence and persecution simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Around 70 countries still criminalise same-sex relations, and in some places the picture is getting worse. Many LGBTQI+ people that we support every day tell us how they faced life-threatening situations back home. For example, Olu, a lesbian from Nigeria had to run for her life when her husband found out she was a lesbian and nearly killed her, or Adams was violently attacked in the street on several occasions by members of his community in Ghana because he was bisexual. We all want to live somewhere where we can be safe and live fulfilling lives and most of us welcome people who are fleeing for their lives. We ask that the PM gets in line with public sentiment and commits to the protection of the rights of LGBTQ+ people seeking safety in the UK.” Disclaimer The content of this website is provided for general information only and should not be relied on as legal advice.

Rainbow Migration,Our response to the Home Secretary who thinks “being gay isn’t reason enough for asylum”,26-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/our-response-to-the-home-secretary-who-think-being-gay-isnt-reason-enough-for-asylum/,"We are appalled to hear that the Home Secretary is questioning the legitimacy of LGBTQI+ people claiming asylum in the UK. Many LGBTQI+ people that we support every day tell us how they faced life-threatening situations back home. For example, we have worked withAdams, who was violently attacked in the street on several occasions by members of his community in Ghana because he was bisexual, and his partner was killed. We also supportedMikiwhose brother threatened to kill him when he came out as a gay man in Azerbaijan. The government’sown statisticssuggest that only 2% of all asylum claims in 2022 included sexual orientation as a reason for needing protection. It is already the case that LGBTQI+ people must face a well-founded fear of persecution to qualify for refugee protection in the UK. They also face the enormous challenge of having to “prove” their sexual orientation or gender identity to get refugee status. Most of us welcome refugees and want to help people who are fleeing for their lives. The Home Secretary should stop her cruel rhetoric and instead create an asylum system that treats people with dignity and compassion.

Rainbow Migration,“To have our human rights respected and protected has changed so many lives forever.”,22-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/to-have-our-human-rights-respected-and-protected-has-changed-so-many-lives-forever/,"My name is Sasha Taylor. I currently live in the UK; I grew up between Guatemala and Mexico, where I volunteered with several organisations as a human rights activist. Thanks to this work I have spent time observing and listening to other people, and seen very closely how difficult, deplorable and unfair life is for an LGBT+ person in those countries. I know this myself through my own personal experiences; I know very well that there is no equality, respect, protection and fulfilment of LGBT+ life and human rights. Even when I saw, lived and faced very difficult situations, I tried to survive and have a life, but there comes a time in life when the mind, and your dignity and self-respect as a human being are not enough to hold on anymore, and that is what happened to me. Being a constant victim of sexual harassment, discrimination, physical and verbal aggression, I had no choice but to flee my country. “I’dlike to celebrateall thesupport Rainbow Migration gave meso I couldsettleinthe UK,and the impact that has had on me and my life and the lives of so many other people.” Yet once I left, I was sold and ended up as a victim of human trafficking. I managed to escape and returned to the UK, but I no longer trusted or believed in anyone. It took me days to get the courage to seek help. I eventually contacted the Samaritans, who put me in touch with other organisations, among them Rainbow Migration (then called UKLGIG). I still remember the day of my first appointment. I arrived near the building, it was about half a block away, for a moment I thought about turning back and not going in, I was struggling emotionally, because of everything that had happened to me. I was scared and distrustful of everything and everyone, but something made me not lose faith, I took courage and went in. The receptionist asked me to wait, then a Support Worker picked me up and we went into a small room. She introduced herself; she had a very friendly face. I felt she was very serene and respectful. She asked me what they could do for me. My English was very bad at that time, so we helped each other with a translation application. I introduced myself, I told her what had happened to me, I told her that I was tired of being a victim and that I needed help. I cried and unburdened myself at that moment, because after so long finally someone listened to me. Since then, I have remained in touch with Rainbow Migration. They helped me with my case, and found me the legal, social, medical and emotional support I needed. Thanks to all that support, today I am here, safe, and with a stable, peaceful and happy life. I’d like to celebrate all the support Rainbow Migration gave me so I could settle in the UK, and the impact that has had on me and my life and the lives of so many other people. To have our human rights respected and protected has changed so many lives forever.

Rainbow Migration,Brook House Inquiry findings: A gay man faced verbal homophobic abuse and was outed by staff in detention,19-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/brook-house-inquiry-findings-a-gay-man-faced-verbal-homophobic-abuse-and-was-outed-by-staff-in-detention/,"Thefirst public inquiryinto immigration detention in the UK, released today, found evidence that a gay man from Morocco had received verbal homophobic abuse from staff while held in immigration detention. The man told the Inquiry that “he did not feel detention was an environment where it was safe to be open about his sexuality” and that “he believed staff were hostile towards gay people”. The report details an incident where a member of staff at the Brook House immigration removal centre told him that he needed to change his clothes “because [he] looked gay” in front of other people in detention, which effectively outed him and caused him to feel unsafe in detention. The report found that the remark was “probably made with the express intention of humiliating” him, and that the officer was likely to know “that his specific choice of words could have placed [the gay man] at risk of harm”. “These findings show, once again, how dangerous immigration detention is for LGBTQI+ people”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration, and continued “LGBTQI+ people face high levels of harassment, abuse and violence from others who are detained or, as this Inquiry shows, even staff”. On top of that, facing abuse in detention can retraumatise LGBTQI+ people, as many will have fled persecution and are already trying to cope with experiences of trauma from their past. The case of mistreatment detailed above is one among a total of 19 incidents of mistreatment that were found by the Brook House inquiry in just a five-month period between April and August 2017. The report also catalogued a deeply troubling list of issues at the centre, including a dysfunctional safeguarding system, excessive and inappropriate use of force and the use of racist and abusive language towards people detained. Under the recently passed Illegal Migration Act, this governmentplans to increase the use of detention, which will put LGBTQI+ people seeking protection in even more dangerous situations. Recent UNHCR report findingssuggestthat supporting people who might otherwise be detained to navigate the asylum and immigration system in the community instead is better for their mental health and wellbeing, costs less than detaining them, and does not affect compliance with Home Office directives. “This government urgently needs to end the use of immigration detention and instead invest in tried and tested community-based approaches that do not carry the same human cost”, said Leila Zadeh. Further findings about the report have been reported byThe GuardianandThe Independent.

Rainbow Migration,“It’s like comparing night and day”: community-based alternatives to detention,15-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/its-like-comparing-night-and-day-community-based-alternatives-to-detention/,"Imagine a world in which people trying to make the UK their home were met with a supportive environment, not a hostile one. A world where people without immigration status were supported to understand their options and make informed decisions about their next steps, rather than being detained and threatened with removal. This approach is not only possible, but tried and tested within the UK. Following a recommendation fromStephen Shaw’s second report on immigration detentionin 2018, the Home Office commissioned a series of pilot projects to test community-based “alternatives to detention”, both of which have now concluded and been subject to an independent evaluation. The results of both initiatives are clear. Supporting people who might otherwise be detained to navigate the asylum and immigration system in the community instead:  We must remember that detaining people going through the asylum and immigration system is a choice our government makes. It’s a choice that destroys lives, tears communities apart and has devastating consequences for those who are locked up with no idea when they might be set free. It puts LGBTQI+ people ina dangerous situationwhere they face bullying, harassment and abuse. Nobody benefits from detention, except the private contractors who are paid millions of pounds a year to run the UK’s detention centres. But we could all benefit from an approach that sees people supported in our communities and empowered to make decisions that are right for them. For LGBTQI+ people who have fled persecution and could otherwise be detained here, it would mean having the chance to live openly and with dignity while they claim asylum in the UK. With an alternative on the table that is compassionate, humane and cost-effective we cannot let this government continue its plans to re-open Campsfield and Haslar detention centres and tender for three new centres as well. Help spread the word about compassionate alternatives to detention byemailing your MP. Read on to learn more about the two pilot projects.  King’s Arms Project – Refugee and Migrant Advice Service Last month UNHCRpublished the evaluation of a pilot projectdelivered by the King’s Arms Project (KAP) in Bedford. Between 2020 and 2022, 84 people without immigration status who were liable to detention were supported in the community through KAP’s Refugee and Migrant Advice Service (RMAS). People taking part in the pilot received free, high-quality legal counselling and one-to-one support from a caseworker. That one-to-one support was flexible and tailored to individual needs – for example help with accessing healthcare, setting up bank accounts, social inclusion or accessing training/volunteer opportunities. By the end of the pilot,80% of people had been offered viable options to regularise their immigration status. They experienced better self-esteem and wellbeing, a better understanding of their legal options, and increased confidence and ability to access entitlements. As a result they were able to make informed decisions about their situation. NatCen, who evaluated the project, estimated the pilot to betwo-thirds cheaper than it would have been to detain the individuals supported. “It’slike comparing day and night. King’s Arms Project is like the day where the sun is out and my life before was like in the night, without stars.” Action Foundation – Action Access RMAS was preceded byAction Access, delivered by the Action Foundation in Newcastle from 2019 – 2021. That project supported women seeking asylum in the UK, most of whom were detained in Yarl’s Wood prior to joining the pilot. As with RMAS, the women were given legal counselling and one-to-one support, however the Action Access pilot also provided them with shared accommodation and subsistence payments. Unsurprisingly,the women moved from detention to this project experienced immediate improvements to their health and wellbeing. They experienced greater stability while on the pilot, and were better able to understand their options and make informed decisions about their asylum cases. Despite being hampered by the coronavirus pandemic and having to run below capacity, Action Access was cheaper per participant per night than detention. In the evaluation NatCen estimated that potential savings from extending the pilot (e.g. running it at capacity and entering into longer leases to save on rents) could see the cost come down toless than half the cost of detaining someone. “In detention, youdon’thave this kind of positive atmosphere. You just want to cry. You just want to stop eating. You just want to kill yourself. This is because you are so in trouble there, right. Then, when you come out,it’slike everything is going to be nice again… the atmosphere isvery different, andI think yourecover yourself.” For more information see: UNHCR’s summary of the two pilot projects NatCen evaluation of the Refugee and Migrant Advice Service (RMAS) NatCen evaluation of Action Access Disclaimer The content of this website is provided for general information only and should not be relied on as legal advice.

Rainbow Migration,More Albanian LGB+ people granted asylum despite country considered ‘safe‘ under new Illegal Migration Act,13-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/more-albanian-lgb-people-granted-asylum-despite-country-considered-safe-under-new-illegal-migration-act/,"New statisticsshow that the number of people from Albania that were recognised[1]as being at risk of persecution due to their sexual orientation in the UK in 2022 more than doubled compared to 2021, it went up from five to thirteen people Albania is one of the countries deemed ‘safe’ underthe recently passed Illegal Migration Act. “By granting asylum to LGB Albanians, this government is acknowledging that Albania is a dangerous country for the community, where they can face life-threatening situations”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration, and added, “However, when the Illegal Migration Act fully comes into force, LGBTQI+ people could be sent to Albania or any other of the 56 countries that this government considers safe”. Hamez, a gay man who fled to the UK from Albania explained last year that: “It was very scary to go back to Albania. My family were pressuring me to get married, and when my parents found out that I was gay, my father chased me out of the house with an axe. I had brought shame on my family, and my father began to be physically abusive. I was hiding in the mountains, trying to find a way to escape my village. It is common for people to get beaten up or killed in my country if someone is found out to be gay.” The statistics also show that the number of LGB people from Nigeria and Ghana that were granted asylum remained steady, 52 and 9 respectively, two countries that are also considered ‘safe’ (in respect of men) under the Illegal Migration Act.  More LGB Ugandans seeking refuge in the UK According to the statistics, up to 54% of the applications received from Ugandan nationals were LGB applications. Over the last year and a half, we’ve supported more than 20 Ugandan LGBTQI+ people to seek protection here and we are concerned that the discriminatory law that was passed in Uganda a few months ago, under which LGBTQI+ people can face life in prison or even the death penalty, will mean many more will have no choice but to flee Uganda. The Illegal Migration Act will make it almost impossible for LGBTQI+ Ugandans to find safety in the UK. If they do, they could be detained and later sent to another dangerous country for LGBTQI+ people. “The inhumane Illegal Migration act should never come into force. Instead, this government should focus on creating a compassionate and caring asylum system that treats people with kindness” said Leila Zadeh.  [1]The experimental statistics show the number of asylum claims where sexual orientation was raised as a basis, or part of the basis, of the claim.

Rainbow Migration,Celebrating 30 years together!,04-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/celebrating-30-years-together/,"This year marks a significant milestone for us as we proudlycelebrate three decades of supporting LGBTQI+ peoplethrough the immigration and asylum system. In the 90s, a group of lesbian, gay and bisexual couples, and their lawyers, campaigned to make it possible for the partner of a British citizen in a same sex relationship to remain in the UK. This was how Rainbow Migration was originally formed. Since then, we’ve continued to campaign for the right of LGBTQI+ people to rebuild their lives free from homophobia, biphobia and/or transphobia here in the UK.

Rainbow Migration,“I am proud of the work we did together”,01-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/i-am-proud-of-the-work-we-did-together/,"I’ve been involved with the organisation for 25 years, since 1998. At the time it was called the Stonewall Immigration Group (SIG). I’d met the person who was to become my life partner, from Thailand, and we were looking at ways to stay together. We began looking for people who could help us and heard about the SIG telephone helpline. After a couple of initial phone calls, I went along to some of the in-person meetings, where LGBTQI+ couples met with lawyers for legal advice. These sessions were very helpful for my own personal situation, but I also became more interested in the Group’s underlying mission to change immigration law. Before I knew it, I started volunteering. As a volunteer, I was able to meet both service users and the volunteer solicitors every month, both in the meetings and socially afterwards. It was hugely reassuring to know that so many people were confronting similar issues and as a bonus I met people who have become very good friends. Eventually I took more of a role in the running of the organisation, becoming a committee member. In summer 2000, when we suddenly found ourselves without an office, I built the original, very basic website in 3 weeks and rebuilt it twice in subsequent years. I didn’t have any previous training, experience or knowledge of website design, but I really enjoyed the challenge, and it was very satisfying when some of the people who came to the Saturday meetings told us how critical it had been to their understanding of their situation. I am told that many couples were able to make straightforward applications without using a solicitor, with the help of the website and forum. “Though theinitialpurpose of the grouphadbeen achieved,itdidn’tmeanour workwas done.Very quickly it was decided, given our established and growing profile, to refocus the mission of the group towards the support of LGBTQI+people seekingasylum.” The work of the Committee in those early days involved coordination of the effort to change the law and planning for the future of the organisation. The Unmarried Partners Concession which was announced not long after New Labour took office in 1997, became law in October 2000, effectively achieving immigration equality for same-sex couples and of course equality then came more widely with Civil Partnerships in 2005. Though the initial purpose of the group had been achieved, it didn’t mean our work was done. Very quickly it was decided, given our established and growing profile, to refocus the mission of the group towards the support of LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum.I became Chair just as the Asylum Support Project was set up with a part time project manager. In early 2004, SIG rebranded to become the UK Gay and Lesbian Immigration Group (UKLGIG) and achieved charitable status. For many years we depended on the generosity of our founders such as Matthew Davies, Mark Watson and Wesley Gryk; by 2006, thanks to increasingly effective fundraising, we were in a position to hire our first Executive Director, Dr. Sebastian Rocca, and we moved into our first permanent office in 2007. It was a very stimulating time to be involved with the organisation; there were huge challenges, but we were encouraged by a growing number of successes. I was always conscious, however, that neither I nor my partner had any lived experience of being an LGBTQI+ refugee or someone seeking asylum. After 2 or 3 years as chair, I decided to step aside for someone with more relevant experience, although I continued helping to run partnership meetings and maintained the group website until 2020. When I first volunteered, I was on duty once a week on the phone lines and once a month at the Saturday meetings. Becoming involved with the organisation like this gave me a new, positive purpose; it was a real pleasure to do something good for people who needed support.I am proud of the work we did together. We and our core group of volunteer solicitors weren’t just campaigners who aimed to be a nuisance to the government. We developed a thoughtful style of gentle persuasion, education, and training. We understood that we couldn’t just scream and shout, despite the injustices all around us. We often faced political, public and tabloid backlash, but we kept going; we achieved so much by maintaining a standard we could sustain through quiet dedication and diligence. “My personal connection with the organisation has been a liberating and highly positive experience, which I continue to value and treasure.” Of course, not everything has always gone according to plan. Public support for LGBTQI+ migrants isn’t commonly flavour of the month, and over the years much of the right-wing press has had no problem reminding us of that. But such biased coverage also meant that good people heard about us and sought us out to show their support. Being part of the charity has been a great privilege for me. It has given me the opportunity for experiences I would have been unlikely to encounter otherwise, meeting people from a diverse range of backgrounds. Former executive director Erin Power called us “unlikely friends”. Such friendships have opened my mind, almost certainly been closer as a result, and taken me in new, exciting directions. UKLGIG became Rainbow Migration after a rebrand in 2020, and I am proud to see them continue to go from strength to strength. My personal connection with the organisation has been a liberating and highly positive experience, which I continue to value and treasure.

Rainbow Migration,“Rainbow Migration has a lot to celebrate!”,01-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/rainbow-migration-has-alot-to-celebrate/,"I first came across Rainbow Migration soon after I arrived in the UK in 2017. At the time I was identifying as a gay man. One of the very first things I did was research support for LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. I found the Rainbow Migration website, which was so helpful and informative, and contacted them about their group meetings. Knowing an organisation like this existed, with in-person support, made me feel safer. I went to a meeting in Birmingham and met a support worker from Rainbow Migration. Even though my English was terrible, I was treated with so much kindness. The support worker was really helpful; she explained what I needed to do and helped me feel less panicked. When you start the asylum process, you’re not an expert, you don’t know anything. you don’t understand what will happen. I was very scared. The support worker really calmed me down and reassured me. It was exactly what I needed. I had just escaped my country.The support worker explained the asylum process to me and advised me to contact the Home Office. Thanks to the Rainbow Migration support worker, I contacted the Home Office, who moved me to Liverpool, and I began to feel a bit happier. Having faced persecution and discrimination in my country of origin, I was able to start exploring my gender identity in the UK. I felt free in Liverpool; I was able to wear what I wanted and to really be myself. Finally, I felt safe to come out as non-binary. I got granted refugee status in 2020. I was the first person to be granted asylum in the UK on the basis of being non-binary. “Rainbow Migration has a lot to celebrate, and I am proud to be part of that. ItIs so important to so many people and should be proud of all it does.” In 2022 I began working with Rainbow Migration as a volunteer for theirNo Pride In Detentioncampaign. Kiki, one of the trustees, asked me if I wanted to be part of the campaigns advisory group; I was so grateful for the opportunity. As part of the group, I’ve contributed to the production of the campaign film, spoken at National Student Pride, recorded a podcast, and helped out at events. It has given me the chance to learn professional skills, to have a say about issues important to me, to express myself, and meet lots of new people. Being part of the campaign has also led to new opportunities for collaboration and has really helped me grow as a person. Being part ofNo Pride In Detentionhas had such a positive impact on my development. Rainbow Migration has a lot to celebrate, and I am proud to be part of that. We are on the right side of history. While rights are consistently under threat, in the UK, and the rest of the world, we will always fight to protect LGBTQI+ people who are seeking safety. It’s scary to go through uncertain times, but organisations like Rainbow Migration make such a difference to so many people’s lives. In the future, I really hope the organisation can keep expanding its services for trans people in the asylum system. Without that support, many would be invisible, and even more marginalised and isolated than they already are. Rainbow Migration Is so important to so many people and should be proud of all it does.

Rainbow Migration,We are celebrating our 30th anniversary: “I love being part of it”,01-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/we-are-celebrating-our-30th-anniversary-i-love-being-part-of-it/,"I first heard about Rainbow Migration in May 2007, after I started transitioning and began to support other trans men. I had a passion for human rights issues and was attending a trans support group, eventually joining their committee. I helped out by answering enquiry emails. One email was from a trans man who wanted help with their transition, but who also needed to claim asylum. I was unsure how to help someone in the asylum system, so I sought advice elsewhere. I contacted Stephen Whittle, an LGBTQI+ activist and trans man, and he suggested the Rainbow Migration legal advice meetings, so I accompanied the service user to one of these meetings. It was in a big room, with many other LGBTQI+ people claiming asylum present. Volunteer lawyers explained the process, and afterwards we had a private conversation with a solicitor. Thanks to their advice, I helped him start the application process. The meeting was a real eye-opener for me. I was blown away by how awful and dehumanising the process is for LGBTQI+ people. I was dismayed by how much evidence people needed to provide to “prove” they are LGBTQI+. It was a wake-up call and convinced me to get more involved with supporting LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum, so I began volunteering with Rainbow Migration. I went along to the meetings to help Sebastian Rocca, Erin Power, and Jill Power. They were all great to work with. I eventually began to support a few more trans men who were claiming asylum. It took a long time, but they all got granted refugee status. “I am particularly proudof our work influencing the new ruling in2009thatmeantLGBTQI+ people who come here seeking safetycouldn’tjust be told to “go home and hide”.That decision hada huge impacton the people we support.” In 2013 I was made redundant; at the same time Erin decided to leave Rainbow Migration. With more time on my hands, I took on more voluntary duties. Erin trained me in bookkeeping, admin, and organising meetings. At the time everything was being run by the trustees, especially Tim Barndon, Jackie Peirce, and Bojana Asanovic. They were very proactive and a great source of support. Eventually they hired a new Executive Director, Paul Dillane, and he secured the funding to offer me paid employment. Working at Rainbow Migration means a lot to me. There’s something about being a refugee that touches me on a very deep level. For people to lose everything they know and love, to not have a home, and yet still have the will to come and start again and build a future in a completely new place and go through a difficult system, says so much about the strength refugees possess. Supporting refugees alongside such a great team really gives me something to feel good about. I am particularly proud of our work influencing the new ruling in 2009 that meant LGBTQI+ people who come here seeking safety couldn’t just be told to “go home and hide”. That decision had a huge impact on the people we support. “I love working for Rainbow Migration.It’svery emotional work for me, andI’mso happy to see theorganisationcontinue togrow. Leila and the trustees have done an amazing job attracting a fantastic group of professionals who know how to do their job so well. I love being part of it and am so grateful to be here.” I am also so proud of how much we’ve grown in recent years, especially since Leila Zadeh was made Executive Director in 2017, and Dane became our Support Services Manager. They’ve built a stronger support structure, and made it safer for everyone, services users and staff alike. They have improved our services, which are more organised and supportive for our service users. Moving offices, to a more private space, has also improved safeguarding. Securing new roles, such as a Legal Officer, has made a tremendous difference as well. I was also so impressed with the way the organisation moved to an online space for remote working during the COVID lockdown. We worked together as a team to maintain support for our service users during a particularly difficult time. While we have so much to be proud of from the last 30 years, there are many things I hope we can celebrate in the future. I really wish for a safe route for people coming here. We need the government to realise that we are not a fortress. People have the right to live in a place that isn’t going to harm them for being who they are. We need to make space for people. We need to care about each other more. I love working for Rainbow Migration. It’s very emotional work for me, and I’m so happy to see the organisation continue to grow. The new policies, safeguarding measures, and the wellbeing activities have all been such welcome, positive developments in the last few years. Leila and the trustees have done an amazing job attracting a fantastic group of professionals who know how to do their job so well. I love being part of it and am so grateful to be here.

Rainbow Migration,Tell your MP about alternatives to detention,29-Aug-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/tell-your-mp-about-alternatives-to-detention/,"We all know thatimmigration detention is unjust and inhumane. Now the UN Refugee Agencyhas published evidenceshowing that a new compassionate approach could be a reality in the UK. We need MPs to see this report. The report covers two UK pilot projects where people were supported with their asylum or immigration cases in the community rather than being detained. Compared to locking people up in detention, providing legal counselling and personalised support in the community wasmore humaneand resulted insignificant improvements in mental healthand wellbeing. At the same time, there wasno evidence of reduced compliancewith the Home Office and the projects were bothcheaperand offeredbetter value for moneythan detention. So why is this government doubling down and planning to open three new detention centres? The harm that detention causes is unjustifiable. For LGBTQI+ people, being cut off from communities of support and subjected to discrimination and abuse inside can make it even worse.

Rainbow Migration,LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum will not be safe on barges,27-Jul-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/lgbtqi-people-seeking-asylum-will-not-be-safe-on-barges/,"Micro Rainbow and Rainbow Migration firmly condemn this government’s barbaric proposal to house people seeking asylum on barges. Wesupport Refugee Council’s open letterto Bibby Marine and agree that barges are unsuitable for housing people seeking asylum in the UK. Furthermore, the doubling of the capacity of the barge, and the movement restrictions placed on the people housed there resemble immigration detention, where LGBTQI+ people are particularly at risk of harm. The overcrowded accommodation and the restrictions on movement for the people living at the Bibby Stockholm will replicate many of the conditions of incarceration. Housing people in prison-like conditions such as those proposed on the Bibby Stockholm risk further traumatising people who are seeking safety and protection. The risks of forced isolation and prison conditions is well known: it is a key facet of Australian border policy. This policy has a detrimental impact on both mental and physical health, andthe UK Government knows this.The situation will be even more dire for LGBTQI+ people. We know that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are particularly at risk of harm and can face serious issues when forced to live in overcrowded conditions. Like in detention, they are likely to experience discrimination and harassment from other people seeking asylum who can hold LGBTQI-phobic views. Trans people can be at even greater risk of abuse and may be forced to hide their gender identity. Rainbow Migration’s 2023pilot study into LGBTQI+ experiences of detentionunderlines the fact that detention-like conditions are unsafe for LGBTQI+ people. It is clear that the conditions on the Bibby Stockholm will differ from immigration detention in name only, and are likely to put LGBTQI+ people at increased risk of harm. Instead, a holistic and community-based response is better suited to safeguarding LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. Micro Rainbow’s tested and successful holistic approach to integration incorporates housing, social-inclusion and moving-on support, and it is a viable and empathetic alternative. Micro Rainbow’s housing is safe, inclusive for LGBTQI+ people, and integrated into the community. People seeking asylum staying in Micro Rainbow housing are not only safe to express their LGBTQI+ identity but also better able to establish community links and networks of support. They can openly and safely contribute to their local communities. Micro Rainbow and Rainbow Migration ask that this government commits to the safeguarding of LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum, and guarantees that LGBTQI+ people will not be housed on barges.

Rainbow Migration,Thank you for speaking out,21-Jul-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/thank-you-for-speaking-out/,"This week the government’s cruelRefugee Ban Billwas passed by Parliament and became law.We are angry and disappointed, but we won’t stop fighting to make the UK a safe and welcoming place for LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. This law will deny the right to asylum to thousands of people who need our protection. It will dramatically increase the government’s powers tolock people upwhile making it even harder to challenge their detention. And it will put LGBTQI+ lives at risk by allowing people to be sent to countries that are not safe for the LGBTQI+ community. We wanted to say thanks to each and every one of you who took the time to write to your MP last weekend.Because of you, the need to protect LGBTQI+ people from being sent to countries where they would be at risk of harm was raised by MPs throughout the debate.We were pleased to see the amendment drew support across political parties. We are sad to say that we could not change the bill on this occasion, but thank you for speaking out for LGBTQI+ people and showing that whatever this government says, these cruel laws do not represent us.

Rainbow Migration,How the UK government is turning a blind eye to the discrimination that LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum will face if sent to Rwanda,04-Jul-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/how-the-uk-government-is-turning-a-blind-eye-to-the-discrimination-that-lgbtq-people-seeking-asylum-will-face-if-sent-to-rwanda/,"By *Innocent Uwimana, a gay man from Rwanda who migrated to the UK around 20 years ago. This article was originally published byPink News.  If theRefugee Ban Billthat is currently going through Parliament is passed into law, LGBTQI+ people who come to the UK seeking protection could be sent to countries which are not safe for them, such as Rwanda. I had the chance to speak to a group of LGBTQ+ Rwandans in the country, who told me about the discrimination they have faced their entire lives because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. During an anonymous meeting online, they expressed their concerns about their lives and explained the risks LGBTQI+ people face in Rwanda. “We don’t understand how the UK government would send LGBTQ+ people here knowing that they will face discrimination. Though the country’s recent human rights advances have been ‘enormous’, not all Rwandans are able to enjoy them equally Indeed, Rwanda is one of the few African countries that doesnot overtly criminalise gay sex,and the country is asignatory to the UN declaration condemning violence against LGBTQ+ people.However, same-sex marriage is prohibited and LGBTQ+ people are not protected from discrimination by any specific legislation. LGBTQ+ people face stigmatisation and abuse in Rwanda every day, and there are many cultural and religious factors which fuel hatred against LGBTQI+ people in Rwandan society.” The people in the group said that religious and cultural arguments are often used to heavily discriminate against anyone perceived to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community.  Religion as an argument to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. Religion is the most common argument people in Rwanda use against LGBTQI+ people. Because of the predominance of Christianity in Rwanda, churches have been particularly vocal in fuelling discrimination against Rwandan LGBTQ+ people. Leaders of the Pentecostal and Catholic churcheshave embraced and been keen to demonstrate bigoted attitudes towards the LGBTQI+ population. In addition, many political and social influencers in Rwandafrequently utilise overtly religious justifications to condemn homosexuality, calling it not only “un-Rwandan,” but also “sacrilegious”. The UK government needs to understand that Rwandans’ conceptions of the world are substantially shaped by their religious beliefs, and that religious ideas heavily shape their attitudes and behaviours. Hostility on the grounds of culture On the other hand, some Rwandan leaders, including political and religious leaders, as well as social media influencers, justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people on the grounds of culture. They claim that homosexuality and non-heteronormative gender identities are not part of the African culture and that theywere brought to Africa by Western countries(especially the US and European countries) so as to impose their cultures on Africa. Some also claimthat Western countries intend to wipe out the African population by promoting homosexuality and discouraging people from heterosexual relationships in which they can have children. In Rwanda, homophobia has evolved into a rallying cry that mobilises the masses by urging them to guard themselves against westernisation and to defend their own culture. However, there is well documented historical evidence of same sex relationships and gender expression variance in many places in Africa, including Rwanda. For example, in Rwanda ‘Cyabakobwa’ (men behaving and dressing as women) and ‘Ibishebago’ (women behaving and dressing as men) were well tolerated and lived in peace in the communities in pre-colonial times. Yet unfortunately this is no longer the case, and LGBTQ+ individuals must hide who they are, or are forced to flee to other nations. The controversial cases of a Rwandan fashion star and a social media influencer The group highlighted the recent case of Moses Turahirwa, a Rwandan fashion star, to illustrate the hostility against LGBTQI+ people in the country. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB)arrested this well-known Rwandan fashion designeron Thursday, April 27 in Kigali. The day before, he uploaded a photo to social media joking about the fact that his passport’s “gender” field had been changed from “M” to “F,” meaning male to female. “Finally, officially a woman on my identity card”, said the artist, who is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. However, the joke sparked lots of hate speech and discrimination against people perceived to be part of the LGBTQ+ community on the grounds of religious and culture arguments. Many people have expressed that LGBTQ+ people should be killed, and the authorities have turned a blind eye to the situation. The government responded by arresting him. On top of being accused of forging official documents, he was also accused of other crimes and the investigation will continue while he remains in custody. Hostility against LGBTQ+ people in Rwanda can also be illustrated by the recent case of a famous DJ and social media influencer who has been accused of being a lesbian. Despite her denying this, many religious leaders and social media influencershave attacked her on the mediaclaiming that she should be arrested or beaten up.  “We hope the UK government will hear our voice” Most LGBTQI+ people want to leave Rwanda. They want to live in a place where they can be free and themselves. So why would the UK government think it is safe to send LGBTQ+ people there? The group of people I chatted to were surprised that a country like the UK, previously known as respecting human rights, is now consciously planning to send LGBTQI+ people to a place where it is known they will face stigmatisation and discrimination. When asked what they hope for from the conversation, the group said, “we hope that the UK government will hear our voice and not put other people in a situation so many others want to get out of. “  *The name of the author has been changed to protect his identity.

Rainbow Migration,MPs raise concerns about this government’s plans to detain and send LGBTQI+ people to Rwanda,27-Jun-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/mps-raise-concerns-about-this-governments-plans-to-detain-and-send-lgbtqi-people-to-rwanda/,"Anew reporton equality and the UK asylum process by the Women and Equalities Committee highlights that new legislation could put LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum at greater risk of harm. Committee Chair, Caroline Nokes MP said: “We were disturbed by the Home Office’s inadequate management of risks of harm to asylum seekers with protected characteristics, including women, LGBT people, children and disabled people. Alarmingly, these risks will increase under the Government’s recent and planned reforms.” Immigration detention and Rwanda MPs are “deeply concerned that the current and planned reforms risk turning back the clock on policies intended to ensure detention is used only as a last resort, and to reduce the risks of harm to vulnerable people.” If theRefugee Ban Billis passed into law, more people could be detained for longer periods of time. This would include LGBTQI+ people, who in detention face bullying, harassment and abuse, with serious consequences for their mental health. The reportrecommends this government set out how it plans to mitigate the risks of harm to LGBTQI+ people indetention, and to collect and monitor data on where LGBTQI+ people are detained and for how long. At the moment, the government does not keep track of LGBTQI+ people in detention, which means that they cannot monitor and reduce the harm of detention to LGBTQI+ people. MPs also expressed their worries about this government’s plans to send LGBTQI+ people to Rwanda andurged it to “set out how it intends to monitor and ensure those removed to Rwanda do not suffer harm or experience discrimination in that country”. At Rainbow Migration,we have called out Rwanda as a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that it LGBTQI+ Rwandans have sought asylum in the UK. “This report, for which Rainbow Migration gave oral and written evidence, is sending a very clear message to this government. The inhumane policies towards people seeking asylum in the UK have to stop immediately. This government’s legislation will put LGBTQI+ people seeking protection in dangerous situations, by detaining them in greater numbers and sending them to countries where they could face discrimination and violence”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration, “instead, this government needs to focus on creating a compassionate and caring asylum system that treats people with kindness”. Dangerous accommodation arrangements for LGBTQI+ people The report also highlights that new contingency accommodation, such as military barracks and barges, being used by this government to house people wanting to rebuild their lives in the UK, is “unacceptable from both safeguarding and equalities perspective”, as it puts LGBTQI+ people at heightened risk of hate crime. Leila Zadeh gave examples of the harassment and abuse experienced by LGBTQI+ people in government-provided accommodation. She explained that in the case of one man in military barracks, he was “ harassed by the others there, and there was no private space—the showers were communal, and they were sleeping in dorms, effectively. We worked very hard with other partner NGOs to try to get this person out but, to our knowledge, vulnerable people are being placed in accommodation like barracks and other forms of contingency accommodation which are completely unsuitable.

Rainbow Migration,4 ways in which you can support LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum,01-Jun-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/4-ways-in-which-you-can-support-lgbtqi-people-seeking-asylum/,"One group that often faces particularly difficult challenges is LGBTQI+ people seeking protection in the UK. They have fled persecution and discrimination in their home countries due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and are seeking safety and a chance to rebuild their lives here. Instead of welcoming them and giving them the support they need,this government is telling them that they’ll be punished for coming here, locked up and sent away toanother country, perhaps one they’ve never heard of, and that may be dangerous for LGBTQI+ people. If you are also outraged by the way LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are treated by this government, here are 4 ways in which you can do something for them during this month – it takes less than a minute per action. Make sure to share this with as many friends as possible!  1. Sign our petition and tell the Prime Minister to ditch his cruel and unworkable Refugee Ban Bill If theRefugee Ban Billbecomes law, LGBTQI+ people who come here seeking protection and safety will face a high probability of being placed in immigration detention. In detention LGBTQI+ people face bullying, harassment and abuse, with serious consequences for their mental health. Following detention they could be sent to countries that are dangerous for LGBTQI+ people and where they don’t have any connections or support. Places like Rwanda, where LGBTQI+ people face discrimination and violence,asInnocent explained. It’s not too late for the Prime Minister to stop this – sign our petition to show these cruel plans do not represent us. 2. Ask your MP to oppose LGBTQI+ detention The number of people being detained in this country has been climbing, and this government still plans to open more detention centres and seek greater powers to detain. Together with the University of Brighton we recently releaseda new pilot studyinto LGBTQI+ experiences of immigration detention since September 2016, which indicates that LGBTQI+ people continue to face harassment, bullying and deteriorating mental health while in immigration detention. Click below to ask your MP if they will oppose LGBTQI+ detention. 3. Join our ‘No Pride in Detention’ campaign You can also join our ‘No Pride in Detention’ campaign . Let’s come together and make sure no LGBTQI+ person is locked up and subjected to violence and abuse in detention. Add your name to say enough is enough: it’s time to #EndLGBTQIDetention. 4. Donate some much needed money We’re working in a challenging environment at the moment, where LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are not made to feel welcome in the UK and government policies are putting people’s lives at risk.

Rainbow Migration,Understanding immigration detention – part 2,25-May-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/understanding-immigration-detention-part-2/,"This is the second of a two-part blog answering some of the mostfrequentlyasked questions we get on social media about our No Pride in Detention campaign.  How many people in immigration detention are LGBTQI+? We cannot be sure of how many LGBTQI+ people are in detention, because this government does not collect or monitor the data. TheHome Affairs Select Committeehas criticised the government for not collecting data on this, as it makes it impossible to accurately identify how many LGBTQI+ people are being detained. What we do know is that even one LGBTQI+ person being locked up for months on end and subjected to bullying, is one too many. Is there anything official, or any studies, which prove that LGBTQI+ people face violence in detention centres? Together with Stonewall, we publishedNo Safe Refugein 2016. The report highlighted the systemic discrimination, abuse and harassment that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum faced both by staff and other people detained.The findings were stark – they faced physical and verbal abuse, deteriorating mental health, inadequate medical care and discriminatory attitudes from staff. Earlier this year, theUniversity of Brightonpublisheda pilot studythat found that UK detention centres continue to be very dangerous places for LGBTQI+ people, with participants reporting attacks from other detained people and inaction from staff in the face of escalating abuse. On top of the UK evidence, similar conclusions have been reached internationally. The International Detention Coalitionpublished a reportin June 2016 reiteratingthat marginalised individuals should never be placed in immigration detention. Their report found that “LGBTQI+ persons face heightened levels of harassment, discrimination, psychological abuse, physical and sexual violence by detention staff as well as other detainees. They are frequently segregated in conditions falling below those of the general detainee population and well-established international standards, or are subjected to policies of solitary confinement, which have been shown to have severe mental and physical health consequences.Almost universally, LGBTQI+ people in detention are in situations of extreme vulnerability”. And in its detention guidelines,the UNHCR (the UN agency responsible for monitoring and protecting refugees)warns that measures must be taken to avoid exposing LGBTQI+ people to the risk of violence or abuse in detention. Where their safety cannot be ensured, alternatives to detention must be considered. The guidelines suggest that LGBTQI+ people should never be kept in isolation or confinement, that all detention staff should be aware and trained in issues relating to LGBTQI+ people, and that LGBTQI+ people should have access to appropriate healthcare and counselling.  What would a victory look like for you and your campaign? A win would mean lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer people are included in theAdults at RiskPolicy. We also need to see improvements to that policy, to ensure that those at risk of harm are correctly identified and excluded from detention. Ending the detention of LGBTQI+ people who are fleeing persecution in their home countries would help keep them safer in the UK. No-one should be locked away as punishment for seeking safety. Supporting people in the community would give LGBTQI+ people the chance to live with dignity and to be open about who they are while they pursue permission to stay in the UK. It would give them a better chance to gather evidence and find appropriate legal representation for their claims. We also want the government to set a time limit of 28 days on all detention, to limit the harms that it is causing to everyone affected – not just the LGBTQI+ community. These wins would be the start of a much-needed overhaul of the UK’s asylum and detention system. We hope it would lead on to meaningful investment in alternatives to detention, declining numbers being detained, and ultimately the end of the use of immigration detention in the UK.

Rainbow Migration,Understanding immigration detention,02-May-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/understanding-immigration-detention/,"Immigration detention is a complex issue that does not always get the attention that a scandal on this scale deserves. As a result, many people are unaware of how itoperatesand who is affected.Weoften get askedwhat immigration detention is, why it is so dangerous for LGBTQI+ people, and howpeople can help.This is the first of a two-part blog answering some of themostfrequentlyaskedquestionswe geton social mediaabout our No Pridein Detention campaign.  How many detention centres are there, and where are they? There are currently seven immigration detention centres (officially known as immigration removal centres) in the UK: But in 2022,this government announced plans to reopentwo more centres: in Campsfield, in Oxfordshire, andHaslarin Gosport, Hampshire. This will allow the government to hold up to an extra thousand people in the immigration detention estate. The government also operates a number of “short term holding facilities”. These are places to detain those who have just arrived in the UK for shorter periods of time while the Home Office assesses their case. Would it be discriminatory to only keep LGBTQI+ people out of detention? Like many other organisations and people in society, we think that detention is unjust and damaging to everyone. But evidence shows that LGBTQI+ people (alongside other groups like pregnant women and survivors of torture) are at even greater risk of harm when detained. We want to see an end to detention in the UK, but while it remains a part of the UK immigration system, we want anyone at additional risk of harm to be kept out of it. The government already has a list of characteristics or experiences that may indicate a person is at greater risk of harm if detained, and that list already includes trans and intersex people. We want the whole LGBTQI+ community to be included in recognition of the risks they face. There isevidencethat LGBTQI+ people are particularly unsafe in detention and should not be detained. They experience bullying, harassment and abuse. This can be from members of staff or from other people who have been detained, who may hold the very same homophobic and transphobic attitudes that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are trying to flee. The situation is urgent. If this government’s new Refugee Ban Bill becomes law, there will be a drastic increase in the number of people detained, as a punishment for seeking asylum. To protect the wellbeing of LGBTQI+ people who are seeking safety in the UK, it is vital to end LGBTQI+ detention.  What are the specific dangers that LGBTQI+ people face within detention? In immigration detention,LGBTQI+ people face high levels ofharassment, abuse and violencefrom others who are detained, or even staff, who ought to be protecting them. Staff in detention centres are supposed to keep people who are detained safe, yet many lack knowledge of LGBTQI+ specific needs, and might even have discriminatory views of their own. In arecent pilot study, LGBTQI+ people in detention spoke about receiving verbal homophobic abuse from staff, and about staff failing to stop physical attacks from others in detention. Others who were interviewed did not report the LGBTQI-phobic abuse they had experienced as they did not feel they would be believed or supported by staff. Facing abuse in detention can retraumatise LGBTQI+ people. In ourNo Safe Refugestudy, Gasha from Cameroon said; “I got flashbacks of everything I’ve been through in Africa. I’ve been free for two or three years and then here I am back in a cell”.  If youdon’twant immigration detention for LGBTQI+ people, what do you think about detention in general? Is there another or better way to deal with asylum claims, or people who might need to be removed? Immigration detention is inhumane and expensive, causing long-term damage to the lives of those detainedandtearing families apart. Although detention should normally only be used when someone is about to be removed from the UK, in the year ending September 2022, ofthepeople leaving detention,83% were released back into the community.Supporting people to get help with their immigration status while living in the community can help them to resolve their cases without the human and economic cost that detention brings. At the moment,community-based case management approaches are being tested across Europe. Thefirst project to report back in the UKfound that providing vulnerable women who were seeking asylum with shared accommodation, intensive support and legal advice in the community: Although this government has officially accepted the recommendations from the evaluation of this pilot, instead of following the evidence they are increasing the use of detention. With an expanding detention estate and new legislation that significantly extends the government’s powers to detain, we need to protect those most at risk more than ever.

Our current board consists of people with a wide range of backgrounds, skills and experiences, including lived experience of the asylum system, law (public law and human rights), academia, communications, fundraising, and finance. We’re interested in hearing about any skills and experience you can bring to the table, especially if you: But don’t worry if you don’t – there are plenty of other valuable skills and experiences that we’re looking for too! We encourage applications from people from all walks of life, and would particularly like to hear from you if you: Still unsure whether this opportunity is for you or not? Here are some frequently asked questions that might help you make a decision.  So what will I be doing? Trustees are legally responsible for Rainbow Migration. Your duties will include: These are some of the matters trustees have discussed in their last few meetings:  What if I don’t have experience as a trustee? Can I still apply? You absolutely can. We will support you to develop in the role. For example, we can ‘buddy you up’ with an existing trustee that you can meet regularly to prepare for board meetings. We also provide training. Will I be able to work with service users? The role of trustees is to govern the charity and ensure we are meeting the purpose for which we exist. You won’t have much involvement in the day-to-day work for the charity, so contact with service users will be limited. I don’t have a computer. Is that a problem? We don’t want technology to be a barrier to becoming a trustee. It’s helpful if you have a smartphone, at least, so that you have regular access to emails and can connect to meetings on Zoom. We can provide training if you need to learn how to use Word or Excel, for example. Please apply and we can talk about how we can help make sure you can participate fully. Can I become a trustee if I’m applying for asylum? We can only accept applications from people with leave to remain in the UK or UK citizenship. We would be happy to consider an application from you to become a trustee when we next recruit if you have secured leave to remain by then.

Rainbow Migration,Why Trans Day of Visibility is so important,31-Mar-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/why-trans-day-of-visibility-is-so-important/,"Sasha Taylor, from Guatemala, went through the asylum system in the UK a few years ago. She has kindly shared her thoughts on how the asylum system could be improved and why it is so important to celebrate Trans Day of Visibility. What would you like to see changed in the current UK asylum system to make it more inclusive of trans people? Firstly, the waiting time to give us an answer to our asylum application. I waited more than two years to receive an answer, which made my depression, anxiety and post trauma disorder so much worse. I received counselling, group therapy, and NHS medication. Lots of people don’t get even that support. I have been able to manage my mental health, and now have a healthy life. I am very grateful for that, but there are still moments when my mental health suffers. This means it can take longer to re-integrate into society and improve ourselves personally and professionally. We need to be good to ourselves, and stay positive, so we can look forward and move on. Second, trans people seeking asylum need access to education. For example, English classes will help people seeking asylum integrate into society. It’s important to note that 99% of LGBT refugees, especially trans people, do not have access to education. They face discrimination because of their gender identity, and lack opportunities, economical resources or official Identification to make the most of educational resources. It took me one year and six months for a school to accept me so I could study English language, and I had to ask for the intervention of a social worker to help me get a place. It is important to understand that learning the language of the country helps you develop your confidence and integration in the society; it opens doors to a better life. Third, we need more access to support workers. They inform us so much, and teach us about our rights and obligations in this country. I was able to have one, because of my type of case, but I know many people do not receive that support and they don’t know anything about those topics. It is necessary to recognise our own human rights, but they also go hand in hand with our obligations and responsibilities too, and that makes us all be a better citizen. It is really important to engage with that because it makes us all more tolerant, and we can move forward together as a society. It can help show politicians that we are human beings, rational and intelligent, that we are not ignorant, or animals that they can move or send from one place to another. Politicians, and society, need more empathy and sensitivity. Why do you think it is important to celebrate Trans Day of Visibility? In many countries, lots of LGBT people are murdered each year. This is especially true for trans people, as they often have a more visible identity. They are particularly subject to violence, attacks and murders. Trans Day of Visibility is so important, but we need more than a one-day celebration. It is an opportunity for politicians, society, and the world in general, to know that trans people are human beings like any other, 365 days a year. We have physical, intellectual and emotional capacities like anyone else. If we are given the right tools to live our lives, and the necessary protection of our human rights, we can be part of this society, and we can develop and move forward with equality, respect, and peace. That’s why it is necessary for politicians to make new legislation, and adapt the laws, so there is justice, inclusion, tolerance and respect for all. It would create a healthier, safer, more inclusive, and humane social environment for all of us, and future generations of trans people, in this country and anywhere in the world.

Rainbow Migration,What does a Support Worker at Rainbow Migration do?,17-Mar-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/what-does-a-support-worker-at-rainbow-migration-do/,"Our team of Support Workersprovideemotional and practical support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and intersex people, who are going through the UK asylum and immigration system.We spoke to one of them,Stuart, who explainedwhat Support Workers do, and why their work is so important. What kind of issues are LGBTQI+ people in the asylum system specifically facing? LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum face particular risks. One of the biggest issues is living conditions. LGBTQI+ people are often housed in inappropriate accommodation, with people who are LGBTQI-phobic. LGBTQI+ people also must ‘prove’ their sexual orientation and gender identity for their asylum application, but this can be very challenging. LGBTQI+ people are sometimes disbelieved by the Home Office, which often wants straightforward, traditional stories of “coming out”, but most of our service users have had to live secret lives as they are fleeing dangerous and homophobic societies. Or the Home Office might expect our service users to provide very specific evidence, such as being in a relationship. They are often isolated which means they aren’t part of an organisation and don’t have LGBTQI+ friends. Often, they are fleeing persecution in their home country, and come to the UK seeking safety. As they have often had to hide their sexual orientation and gender identity, it can be very difficult for them to provide any evidence they are LGBTQI+. They might also need to avoid other people from their country, because they might be at risk of facing the LGBTQI-phobic abuse they are fleeing. This means that LGBTQI+ people in the asylum system in the UK need specific support and safeguarding throughout the asylum process, which we aim to provide for them. What does a Support Worker at Rainbow Migration do? Primarily, we provide one-on-one emotional support. We also have men’s, women’s and trans support groups. We meet, in person, twice a month. This is an opportunity for our service users to meet other people in similar situations, and to share our good or bad news with each other. It’s a way of building a support network, and it’s a really important part of our service. Generally, our service users are very isolated. The pandemic made that worse. We are here to talk to them. They are often new to the UK and don’t know many people. Often, they keep their sexual orientation, gender identity, and their asylum status to themselves. Many are used to having to hide who they are, having faced a lot of stigma both in their home countries and here in the UK. They are often traumatised and may find it difficult to talk to strangers in a Home Office interview. We help them deal with what can be very stressful situations. We help our service users access safe housing and healthcare. We talk to them about mental health, and if we need to, find them a therapist or counsellor, or make sure they have access to the right medication. Sometimes we cover their costs for healthcare, or essential purchases such as hygiene products or food. We also have a legal team to guide them through the asylum process, and they help them find legal representation. We refer our service users to legal aid solicitors, or for pro-bono advice. We also have monthly partnership sessions, where pro-bono solicitors offer free advice to LGBTQI+ couples who need support when one or both partners need a visa to stay in the UK, as the process for couples is different. All our services are free, confidential, and available before and during their asylum claim.  What does a typical day for a Support Worker look like? I book calls and have catchups with service users. Most of my service users don’t have many people to talk to, so it’s important I can be there for them. Sometimes I have emergencies, such as someone being made homeless, or someone urgently needing a solicitor. Many of my service users feel very low and are having mental health crises; so, I take lots of time each day to be as much of a support to them as possible. This can be in person, over the phone, or by email. Many feel unheard, invisible, ignored, helpless. I am here to listen and help as much as I can. Every two weeks I run the men’s support group. We meet in person, and at the moment we have about 15 men in the group. It is a safe space, for our service users to share their stories, listen to each other, and be themselves without judgement. What is the asylum process like? It can take years to claim asylum. Some of our service users wait as long as five years to hear a decision. Many wait two years just for the interview. They just don’t know when they’ll hear. There’s no pattern, it’s not like the Home Office is working through an organised waiting list. It’s impossible to say when people will hear about their case. Their lives are on hold. It’s a very long, frustrating waiting game. Whilst they’re waiting, they’re trying to live on £40 a week. It’s almost impossible. After a year you can apply to work but only for specific jobs such as care, but many of our service users are not in a situation to provide care for others. Many of them are facing their own mental health issues. Most of them need too much support to then be supporters and carers themselves. How could the system be improved? People seeking asylum should be able to work, have access to better housing, and have a choice about where to live. There should be more LGBTQI+ accommodation, such as the ones that Micro Rainbow already provides. Trans people seeking asylum are especially at risk.  LGBTQI+ people should be able to live and work safely. The process is so expensive, yet also so slow. The application system needs a time limit; people should be guaranteed an interview and a decision by a certain time. It’s so cruel to keep people waiting, in poverty, for years. The fact that the system is getting even slower since the pandemic is ridiculous. LGBTQI+ people in immigration detention are not safe. They shouldn’t detain anyone; the use of indefinite immigration detention is inhumane. At the moment, people can be detained in these centres for months and even years. Their lives are in total limbo. The system is terrible for everyone, but it especially harms LGBTQI+ people. Those seeking asylum should be able to work. Instead they are housed in Home Office accommodation, with nothing to do; the current system costs a huge amount, and no-one in this country benefits, financially, or otherwise. We need a massive change in the way the media reports asylum; we need to change public opinion around it. We need a change in the asylum system. The whole process is broken.  What is the best thing about your job? Well, my job shouldn’t exist. If we had a better, more humane system, my role wouldn’t be necessary! But as it is, I do the best I can. What I will say is that I have the most amazing team and support network around me. My colleagues are fantastic, and I couldn’t do this job without them.

Rainbow Migration,Government’s new asylum bill fails to consider the safety of LGBTQI+ people seeking safety here,15-Mar-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/governments-new-asylum-bill-fails-to-consider-the-safety-of-lgbtqi-people-seeking-safety-here/,"Last week, the government announced yet another cruelasylum billthat punishes people seeking to rebuild their lives in the UK. Among other things, the bill proposes to send people who have fled life-threatening situations in their home countries, and sought safety and protection from the UK, toa list of countries(page 64) that includescountries that are not safe for LGBTQI+ people. For instance, Ghana is set as one of the countries that is deemed to be safe for men, however as recently as December 2022,Adams, a bisexual man from Ghana that we supported was granted asylum in the UK. He told us that “generally society [in Ghana] is very homophobic, including much of my family, who wanted me to change. I was violently attacked in the street on several occasions, and I knew it wasn’t safe for me stay in Ghana as an openly bisexual man”. Another country deemed safe to send men seeking safety in the UK is Nigeria. However, in 2021 government statistics show that up to 50 people were granted asylum on the grounds of their sexual orientation (no gender breakdown is provided). Last year,Joel, a gay activist from Nigeria, describedhow a law passed in 2014 “prohibits same-sex marriage and ruthlessly punishes LGBT+ people in Nigeria. In addition to prohibiting same-sex marriage, the law legitimised oppression and was used by authorities to justify persecution”, and added that “citizens can carry out ‘jungle justice’ without repercussions; lynching and murder of LGBT+ people is a common occurrence”. Rwanda is among the countries in the list as well, whichwe have repeatedly called outas a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that it is a source country for people seeking asylum in the UK based on their sexual orientation, albeit in low numbers, and Rainbow Migration has previously provided support to LGBTQI+ people from Rwanda. Innocent Uwimana, a gay man from Rwanda,has writtenabout how dangerous it is for LGBTQI+ people there and urged the government to ditch the proposal.  Increased risk of immigration detention The new bill also greatly extends the powers to hold people in immigration detention, whilst simultaneously restricting their ability to challenge this. This will result in a vast increase in the number of people who could be locked away, which will include LGBTQI+ people, who we know are at additional risk of harm in detention centres. Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration said: “By introducing this heartless and cruel bill, this government is sending a message that it doesn’t care about the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQI+ people seeking protection here. We have already received calls from LGBTQI+ people expressing distress about the potential impact of the bill on their lives, telling us they feel ‘unwelcome’ here”. We are urging this government to stop this inhumane and dangerous bill immediately and instead focus on creating a compassionate and caring asylum system that treats people with kindness.

Rainbow Migration,LGBTQI+ people still at serious risk of harm in immigration detention,08-Feb-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/lgbtqi-people-still-at-serious-risk-of-harm-in-immigration-detention/,"A new pilot study into LGBTQI+ experiences of immigration detention since September 2016 indicates that LGBTQI+ people continue to face harassment, bullying and deteriorating mental health while in immigration detention. The study, conducted by Dr Laura Harvey at the University of Brighton and supported by Rainbow Migration, looks at the experiences in detention of five members of the LGBTQI+ community – three gay men and two non-binary people. Four of the participants were held in Immigration Removal Centres for several months, and one in a Short-Term Holding Facility for 48 hours.  Key findings – LGBTQI+ people not safe in immigration detention Participants in the research experienced verbal and physical homophobic abuse from other people held in detention, including from individuals they were forced to share locked rooms with at night. Usman* described how he reported someone who“spat on my face for being a gay”, but was still made to share a room with this person until they attacked him physically. As a result of this violence and intimidation, participants feared being ‘out’ while in detention and felt a need to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. However, they were not always able to do this despite trying to, so they remained exposed to the risk of bullying and abuse. Johnson* said:“I don’t want to hide my sexuality here but I didn’t tell anyone because I was so scared.” Although some participants found staff to be a source of help and support, others reported problems including verbal homophobic abuse from staff, being afraid to report homophobic bullying to staff, inaction from staff in the face of escalating homophobic bullying and misgendering by staff. Overall, participants experienced worsening mental health and delayed access to mental health support while in detention, as well as being put in situations that resembled past traumatic experiences. Johnson* had suffered violent homophobic attacks in their home country – including one in which their partner was killed – and was identified by a GP in detention as needing mental health support. However they waited three months to be seen by a psychiatrist, during which time they had to share a locked room with someone who was openly homophobic towards them.  Ending LGBTQI+ detention remains as urgent as ever The research aimed to explore whether experiences of LGBTQI+ people in detention had changed significantly since thelast piece of researchon this topic in 2016 and after the introduction of theAdults at Risk in Immigration Detention policythat same year, which recognised the heightened risk of harm to trans and intersex people in detention. According to the findings, LGBTQI+ people still face considerable and ongoing risk of harm in immigration detention in the UK. The data suggest that detention centres are inherently risky for LGBTQI+ people, who are trapped in a space that they cannot leave, in which abuse and harassment are difficult to escape. With the government nowincreasing its use of immigration detentionit is crucial they recognise thatpeople who cannot be kept safe from harm in detention should never be placed there. That applies to all members of the LGBTQI+ community. If you agree pleaseemail your MPto ask if they oppose LGBTQI+ detention and let us know their response. * All names used for participants are pseudonyms to protect their anonymity.

Rainbow Migration,“It is a way of getting my voice heard in cases where it normally wouldn’t be heard”,06-Feb-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/it-is-a-way-of-getting-my-voice-heard-in-cases-where-it-normally-wouldnt-be-heard/,"We work with a ‘Campaigns Advisory Group’ made up of LGBTQI+ people with lived experience of the UK asylum system to steer our public campaigning. The group meets regularly with staff to plan, deliver and evaluate activities for ourNo Pride In Detention campaign. Vanessa, one of the current members, told us her thoughts on being part of this group. “I came across the advisory role from a friend who knows how passionate I am about the rights of LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum and refugees. At first I was hesitant because I am a bit anxious but I went for it. I remember the interview with Emma and Carla, it was very informal and I was literally on a coach to Manchester. Talking to Emma about my expected commitment got me very excited and I looked forward to joining the advisory team. I remember receiving the email that I was successful and feeling hopeful for the future and participating in influencing decisions. It has been a very good experience, I have learnt so much about the refugee system, apart from experiencing the asylum system, from the research and reports that have been conducted I have walked in the shoes of others.” It is a way of getting my voice heard in cases where it normally wouldn’t be heard. The best part about this is being able to influence decisions, coming up with ideas for campaigns, participating in events. It is a way of getting my voice heard in cases where it normally wouldn’t be heard. I had heard about detention centres but never heard stories from LGBTQ+ people who had actually stayed in detention centres. Being in the advisory group has opened my eyes to the struggles and has also created the passion to lend my voice and words against detention. Imagine leaving a country that restricts your rights and freedom and then getting into a prison like environment, it can be devastating. So whether it is silently lending your voice, participating in campaigns and researches, if you are passionate about helping people then this is the right place.”  To learn more aboutRainbow Migration’sCampaigns Advisory Group and how you canget involved,pleasesee the role descriptionand application form.

Rainbow Migration,Travelling as a person with refugee status,23-Jan-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/travelling-as-a-person-with-refugee-status/,"Have you recently been granted refugee status? If so, this is probably a big moment for you and you will surely be feeling a sense of relief. There is quite a lot to sort out in your life and to help with that we havea guide that outlines how you can access housing, benefits, education, training and employment after you have been granted. But you might have some broader questions as well, like whether you can leave the country and whether it is safe for you to travel abroad particularly as an LGBTQI+ person. Our Trustee, Ucman Scher, is a former refugee and has travelled extensively to over 75 countries and blogs underBrownBoyTravels. He has kindly provided some information about his personal experiences of travelling after being granted refugee status. You can find more of Ucman’s travel tips and tricks on hisblog,Instagram,TikTokandYouTubechannel. **Before we proceed, please be awarethat this article is based on real life experience andshould not be taken aslegal advice.For all legal matters, please consult a lawyer or relevantprofessional.** What is refugee travel and why is it any different from non-refugee travel? Travelling as a person with refugee status is quite a different experience from regular travel because the rules that apply to air travel and crossing borders are different. A good example is theSchengen Area. While anyone else with a Schengen visa can travel freely within the zone, each country applies a different requirement for people with refugee status. Safety is also a concern as is the risk of losing your documentation abroad. Are people with refugee status allowed to travel? Yes and no. The most common misconception is that once you have refugee status you are supposed to stay in the same country, work, build your life and that’s pretty much it. I call it the guilt of pleasure. Just because you have been granted asylum status doesn’t mean you should deny yourself any pleasures of life, and travelling is one of the best of them. You can travel to broaden your horizons and gain new experiences. In my case it really helped me heal trauma. Learning about other cultures, and meeting new, kind people all over the world has helped me see  life from a different perspective. The only exception is travelling to your home country. This is a serious issue and your asylum can be revoked on return. More importantly you shouldn’t travel there since your life might be in  danger in your home country. What documentation do you need to travel as a person with refugee status? As part of your asylum application, the Home Office will have taken your national passport away. However you can apply for and travel with aRefugee travel documentthat the Home Office can issue. You will need someone to verify/certify the application. You should always keep yourBRPon you at all times, you need it to re-enter the country. I have a refugee travel document, should I book my tickets and get ready to fly now? Not quite yet! We still have some more preparation to do before that flight. If you receive benefits, you should check the conditions of your benefits before and if the travel is essential, you must notify the job centre and get permission from your benefits case handler to travel as an exception. The next big item on the to-do list is checking whether you require a visa to enter your chosen destination. What is the process of obtaining visas as a refugee? This is the most difficult part of your plans, and  the most annoying part of travelling. Like I mentioned before,  every single country in the EU and Schengen Area has different rules for people travelling with refugee status and you must check the embassy or consulate website for each country before you plan your travels. Finding out if and how you need a visa is also a little bit of a painful process, as you must go beyond the  British citizens’ page on the embassy or consulate website. For some countries, it will be quite clear.  Other times it will be quite ambiguous, and in some cases, there might not be any information. If this is the case, you can go to Ministry of Foreign Affairs website and look for the information there. If it is not available on their website, you will have to write to or call the embassy to find out the necessary information. I would also highly recommend keeping the embassy link or written communication with you when you go to the airport. For example, when I tried to visit Iceland there was an issue with my visa status. According to the Icelandic consulate in London, I did not need a visa, but the airline and the border agency of Iceland insisted that I did. I was not allowed into the plane and had to come back to London. I then waited for the consulate to open the next morning and got written permission to board the next flight, for a trip I had arranged for my birthday with my friends. All these problems slightly spoiled the occasion, but sadly this is the reality of travelling as a person with refugee status. Other practical tips: General safety tips: 1- Don’t tell anyone that you have refugee status unless you trust them completely. Romantic liaisons abroad shouldn’t fall into the trusted category, I’m afraid. 2-Keep your travel document and BRP safe at all times, I’d go as far as saying, keep it dearer than your life.It is the most important item whilst you are travelling.If you loseit,you will have to apply for a newvisa(notjust the refugee traveldocument) and doing so in a foreign land can be costly and quite a headache with all the paperwork and documentation. I would recommend keeping it inasafe andhavinga coloured copyof iton you at all times,toavoid taking it around with you. 3- You should also be aware that you are not a British Citizen and the British consulates do not offer protection topeople with refugee statusas such; in short you are on your own. Do not do anything illegal or get intoanytrouble, thiswould put you in a very vulnerable situation.The most common reasonpeople have issues abroad is becausetheyuse recreational drugs. Obey the law and be responsible and you’ll be perfectly fine. I have never had to contact a British embassy abroad sounfortunatelyI cannot tell you how long it would take to get your documentation in order or how helpful they are in case of legal trouble.If you have someexperience, please do reach outto mewith your experience, I’m always glad to hearother people’sexperiences. Is there any other advice you’d like to give? All of the information above might seem daunting but once you arrive at your destination, it will be worth it. Travelling will help you with so many things. I always say, Eat, travel and be merry!

Rainbow Migration,Less scrutiny means more risk for LGBTQI+ people in detention,18-Jan-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/less-scrutiny-means-more-risk-for-lgbtqi-people-in-detention/,"ThisGovernmenthas stopped commissioningtheannualindependentreviews into the treatment of vulnerable adultsinimmigrationdetention.If there is no onethat keeps an eye onthe conditionsin detention,LGBTQI+ people couldbe put at risk ofmoreharm. Last week, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI), David Neal, and the former Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Stephen Shaw CBE,reportedthat this Government was ending their annual independent investigations into the treatment of vulnerable adults in detention. What is the Adults at Risk policy and how long has it been independently reviewed? TheAdults at Risk policy(AaR) recognises that certain groups of people may be “particularly vulnerable to harm in detention” and creates a presumption that these groups should not be detained. The AaR includes trans and intersex people and our ‘No Pride in Detention’campaign is calling for lesbians, gay and bisexual people to also be included in this policy, as there is evidence that they also experience homophobic bullying, harassment and abuse when locked up. The ICIBI carries out reviews on the effectiveness of the Home Office’s practices and policies towards adults at risk in immigration detention since 2015 and makes recommendations to improve the conditions of detention. But as the ICIBInotes, “though many recommendations arising from our reviews and inspections have been accepted, progress in implementing them has been painfully slow”. For instance, in 2019, Inhis report on the Adults at Risk annual inspection, the ICIBI commented upon the fact that the Home Office does not collect data on the number of LGBTQI+ people who are detained, and therefore it was “hard to see how the Home Office is able to assess the quality of its decisions to detain or the impacts of detention on specific group”. This is a recommendation that has not been implemented yet. Latest ICIBI report released The news about the end of these reviews comes as the last annual report hasjust been released, in which the Inspectorate reports that “officers in both Yarl’s Wood and Harmondsworth [detention centres] told inspectors that being under-resourced and carrying vacancies was negatively affecting the delivery of their required engagement activity”, with delays of “up to a month”. The “engagement activity” includes inductions for new arrivals to detention, in which LGBTQI+ people have the opportunity to raise their sexual orientation and/or gender identity with officials. If people don’t have the opportunity to raise that they are LGBTQI+ when they enter the detention centre, it can be more difficult to raise this at a later stage, and people may not be made aware of policies that are in place to protect them from bullying, discrimination and abuse. With these inspections coming to an end, the Home Office will face less pressure to comply with the policy and improve conditions in detention for adults at risk, including LGBTQI+ people. The Governmenthas saidit plans to “take the welfare of detained individuals extremely seriously”, but at Rainbow Migration we find it hard to understand how they are going to achieve that while dismantling the independent scrutiny mechanisms in place. Immigration detention is not safe for anyone. Being detained puts many people who are often already traumatised, at even greater risk of poor mental health and suicide. This is especially true for LGBTQI+ people. Instead of trying to end the annual reviews on the adults at risk policy’s effectiveness, this Government should put an end to the detention of LGBTQI+ people and set a time limit on all immigration detention.

Rainbow Migration,“I aspire to create a community that can champion kindness and caring”,14-Dec-22,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/in-the-week-leading-up-to-international-migrants-day-18-december-we-celebrate-everyone-who-has-moved-across-international-borders-whether-by-choice-or-necessity/,"In the week leading up toInternational Migrants Day(18 December), we celebrate everyone who has moved across international borders, whether by choice or necessity. This yearwe have partnered up with IOM and IMIXto highlight the voice of Zarith, one of the people that we arecurrently supportingand a lived experience ambassador of theInternational Migrants Day Ambassador Programme. Zarithis a journalist, a poet, and a “wannabeastronaut”, as he describes himself. He came to the UK to start a new life, free from harm, and is currently awaiting a decision on whether this government will allow him to live in safety in the UK. If he is granted asylum, he hopes to continue his studies at University College London. He recentlytold Pink News: “We are people. We have lots to give. We want to add value to the country that we are in, and I’m really sad if the UK is going to [regress] in terms of human rights and protection for asylum seekers. That would be a really dark day for the UK.” Here is part of his blog: From a boy who runs around the village half- naked with my mum’s veil, while playing at serving ‘regal ’ afternoon tea to becoming a young scientist at 13, it has been a global soul searching for me to fit in somewhere I can safely and finally call my ‘home’. Born in a tropical island in Malaysia, a multicultural home set a deeply rooted, dynamic and diverse foundation that would carry me in various parts of the world. Not much interested in ‘manly ’sports in my younger days, romantic English literature from the likes of Jane Austen & William Wordsworth took me to faraway misty English countryside, often fantasising of my knight in shining armour. Thanks to my sister, she also introduced me to classical music, and I demanded to learn to play piano and master a few languages. As a chubby kid who loved a myriad of intercultural gastronomic delights, food has become central to one of my passions which is cooking. Having a beloved grandmother on my side who cooked almost every day, she lovingly hand-fed me simple, flavourful, home cooked meals. Having both of my parents who worked full time, my late grandmother was not only my source of inspiration but also the most altruistic soul who instilled in me bountiful gentleness, affection, empathy, and kindness to become the softhearted person that I am today. I could not thank her enough to be in my formative life to my mid teenage years. When she passed on, it was the biggest blow in my entire life as I felt as my wings had been clipped & my heart had been wrenched out of my ribcage. I remember reading her newspaper articles in her later years as she was unable to read due to her vision impairment, not knowing that I would become a journalist one day.
