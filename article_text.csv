Migrants' Rights Network,New migration measures reinforce classism and racism,11-Dec-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/12/11/new-migration-measures-classism-racism/,"Update: On 21st December 2023, the Home Office announced a change on the minimum salary requirement for British nationals bringing foreign family members to the UK, saying the threshold will first be raised to £29,000 instead of £38,700. The new Home Secretary has hit the ground running by announcing measures to bring about “the biggest ever reduction in net migration” in an attempt to cut migration by 300,000. The policies included a crackdown on dependents, raising the minimum salary required in a job offer to obtain a Skilled Worker visa and a review of the Shortage Occupation List. But what does this all mean, what will its impact be, and how are they racist and classist? Pitting workers against each other Much of the language of the Home Secretary’s speech focused on protecting British workers from migrants who will accept lower wages. This was the case for both increasing minimum salary requirements and ending the 20% lower wages for workers filling a role on the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). This pits workers against each other, obscuring the same institutions and systems that are responsible for the exploitation of them all. Giving the same justification of preventing migrants from “undercutting” domestic workers, the Home Secretary also announced that the SOL will be reviewed, in order to remove certain occupations from the list. While we agree with the scrapping of measures that allow employers to pay migrant workers 20% less than domestic workers, especially in already low-paid industries, we oppose the SOL. In fact, the Migration Advisory Committee has recommended that it be abolished. Migrants shouldn’t be restricted to certain roles. People come to the UK with a variety of skills and knowledge – why are we trying to restrict that? Alongside extortionate increases in the health surcharge, the measures amount to the creation of a two-tiered society for migrants, where only middle/upper-middle class people and above are able to migrate to this country and bring their families and survive. Even for people who do meet this threshold and don’t work in health or social care, health surcharge payments for a family can be financially debilitating – £11,000 for a family of six before the higher rate is even calculated. We don’t believe that migrants should be accepted solely on the criteria of their economic “contribution” , and, therefore, shut out if they don’t meet this. Of course migrants are essential to core industries, such as healthcare and hospitality, and without them these sectors would undoubtedly collapse. But this shouldn’t need to be said. Our pro-migrant arguments should be centred around solidarity and compassion, not around “contribution”. Breaking up families The news that people on the Health and Care Worker visa will be unable to bring dependents to the UK will break up families. Splitting up migrant families is becoming something of a trend, following the end to students being able to bring dependents with them on a Tier 4 visa, with the only exception being people on postgraduate research courses. It is unrealistic for the Government to expect the same numbers of migrants working in health and social care (a sector that has been reliant on overseas workers in recent years)  to leave their families behind, with many likely having care responsibilities. This move will increase isolation, especially in an already hostile environment for migrants. The other policy that the Government introduced that will affect families is the drastic increase in the minimum income level for family visas from £18,600 to £38,700. These policies are discriminatory. The right to a family life has become a class privilege- one that is gendered and racialised, as women and people of Colour earn less on average than White men. People of Colour in the UK are 2.5 times more likely to be in poverty compared to White people due to the systems of racism and capitalism. For women, we must consider not just the gender pay gap , but also the conditions of patriarchy that place caring responsibilities in paid and unpaid roles primarily on women. Students International students are already subjected to intrusive monitoring and strict visa conditions, which we are investigating as part of our research . It is already cruel and unfair to deny most international students the ability to bring their families with them to the UK, but these latest restrictions on their visa further limit their freedom and future in this country. It relies on the false notion that international students are using student visas as a means to get to this country under false pretences. This is a nonsensical argument considering the thousands they will have invested to come to study, and how the hostile environment and compliance monitoring of international students means they must complete their studies to remain in the UK. All this does is demonise these students, who instead require more lenience, in relation to the stresses of constant monitoring and strict limitations on their ability to switch to other visas once completing their course. With a pending review of the Graduate visa, we already know that employers do not always understand how the Graduate visa scheme functions, and that after the two years sponsorship free employment it offers, there is difficulty in transitioning to a sponsored visa system after its expiry. Therefore, it is clear that the Graduate visa does need to change, but not in a way that makes life in the UK harder for people on this route. Fundamentally, the new measures announced as part of the Government’s attack on a huge swathe of migrants here and those intending to come, will cause immense amounts of harm to communities, ignoring why people come to the UK in the first place. For many workers in low paid jobs, the UK has had a hand in creating the conditions in which they were forced to emigrate to work, whether through the legacies of past colonial exploitation, support for neoliberal economic policies that disadvantage workers, or support for repressive governments. The persistent fixation on net migration figures is a political distraction technique that has devastating consequences for migrant communities. Viewing migrants only as numbers and not as people is dehumanising, and we should be welcoming more migrants at this time. We cannot let this Government divide us and manufacture problems to blame on migrants."
Migrants' Rights Network,Digital Hostile Environment: Passports and Facial Recognition,28-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/28/passport-facial-recognition/,"The Government has proposed using people’s passports and biometric residence permits for facial recognition. This kind of technology contributes to the increasing digitisation of the border, pushing border surveillance deeper into all of our lives. At MRN, we are concerned about the usage of travel and visa documents being used in this way, as it increases the precarious status of migratised communities in particular. We will be challenging this practice alongside our wider opposition to plans to share personal data with the police and Home Office What’s the plan? The proposal for using people’s identification documents in domestic criminal investigations comes after supermarkets reported increased numbers of thefts amidst the ongoing cost of living crisis. The policing minister, Chris Philp, revealed this at the Conservative Party conference, stating that police officers will soon be instructed to search these databases. His statement followed an announcement from the Home Office and Ministry of Defence on expanding the use of facial recognition technology. The Policing Minister has since called for police forces to double their usage of this technology by May 2024 This comes amidst the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, which could remove passports from Britain’s successor to GDPR regulations, as well as routes to effective judicial redress. It is alarming that the already lax laws governing the usage of this kind of personal data could be weakened more. It is also essential to contextualise these moves within other authoritarian legislation, such as the Public Order Act 2022, and the increasing usage of facial recognition technology. The gendered and racialised inaccuracies of the technology are worrying and reason enough to halt the expansion of facial recognition and the sources it draws from, but we fundamentally oppose it for the following reasons: The expansion of surveillance into all of our lives disproportionately affects migratised people by expanding the digital Hostile Environment. In particular, this technology advances data collection about people’s movement within London, extending the surveillance of migratised populations that already takes place through GPS ankle tagging and data sharing in public services, like the NHS, and social services. We should be stopping all data sharing of this nature, not expanding it. Check out our other work on the digital hostile environment and digitisation of the UK border."
Migrants' Rights Network,Deprivation of citizenship is Islamophobic,20-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/20/deprivation-of-citizenship-is-islamophobic/,"A blog for Islamophobia Awareness Month 2023 Greater powers to deprive people of their British citizenship were introduced under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022. But the laws to deprive certain citizens of their citizenship has been in power a lot longer, and interestingly it is used predominantly for selected groups of people. It’s important to look at who these laws are aimed at and why. Who is being targetted? Denial or deprivation of citizenship is a core part of embedding Islamophobia in policy, particularly in Europe, South Asia and the US. This is also the case in the UK, where immigration and nationality legislation over the last twenty years has made it easier to deprive people of British citizenship. Muslims are most affected by these powers. Deprivation of citizenship is therefore a primary aspect of Islamophobia in Britain’s migration system. Racism, Islamophobia + gender The subjects of citizenship deprivation in Britain on ‘public good’ grounds have almost exclusively been Muslim and largely from a South Asian, Middle Eastern or North African background. An investigation carried out by the New Statesman discovered that 41% of People of Colour in Britain could be potentially deprived of their citizenship versus 5% of White people. Therefore, it is clear that racialised citizens and Muslims in particular are considered ‘less’ British by the State.  There is significant evidence to demonstrate the connections between racist War on Terror logics and citizenship deprivation . This racism is especially evident in cases affecting people with Bangladeshi heritage . The Immigration Act 2014 allowed the Government to deprive people of their citizenship even if they hold no other citizenship. For those from Bangladeshi heritage, the UK Government  misinterpreted Bangladeshi citizenship law, where it states that people of Bangladeshi heritage are able to claim Bangladeshi citizenship, but this must be claimed by the age of 21. In all of these cases , they were able to retain their British citizenship, because they were over 21. Shamima Begum is a prominent case here. The UK Government revoked her citizenship based on the assumption that she would not be left ‘stateless’ but would have access to  Bangladeshi citizenship. However, Bangladesh has been adamant that her claim to Bangladeshi citizenship would be refused if she attempted to claim it. Another public example of citizenship deprivation has been the case for Abu Hamza, where Egypt stripped him of his citizenship. At the same time, the British Government attempted to do the same, and attempted to deport him to Egypt. In the end, he was extradited to the USA. Citizenship deprivation is also gendered, as it is mostly men who are impacted. This reflects a decades-long construction of racialised men as emblematic of a foreign threat to the nation. These are examples of a double standard of punishment for Muslim and racialised British citizens, where the British Government dispossesses them and abdicates responsibility, but there is not the same basis for White Britons with sole British citizenship. This is exacerbated by the fact that most cases of citizenship deprivation now take place while the person is out of the country and therefore unable to re-enter Britain. As long as the practice of deprivation of citizenship continues in this manner, Muslims and People of Colour will always have second-class citizenship in Britain. Counter-terror Deprivation of citizenship and counter-terror laws are linked: most cases of deprivation on ‘public good’ grounds have been justified using counter-terror legislation. The disproportionate impact of citizenship deprivation on Muslims and People of Colour is amplified by the UK’s counter-terror measures that contribute to heightened Islamophobia. Together, citizenship deprivation and counter-terror powers intensify the idea that Muslims and migratised groups are ‘anti-British’. The definitions of offences warranting deprivation of citizenship are vague and subjective – in situations where the Home Secretary views deprivation to be conducive to the public good. This includes references to ‘terrorism’ and ‘extremism’, which have often been defined in relation to the political objectives of the British Government, such as the controversial proscription of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) and the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party). This leaves room for ‘arbitrary application and abuse’; neither ‘public good’ in nationality legislation nor ‘extremism’ are adequately defined . This is evident in the lowering of the barrier of proof for counter-terror offences, where intention is given less value than in other crimes, and where defendants bear the burden of proving innocence. This means that migration is increasingly viewed through national security terms against a backdrop of Islamophobia reinforced by the War on Terror. The figure of the migrant is imagined as Muslim, often male, and seen as a (potential) security threat. This is also internalised, extended towards citizens and residents that resemble the ‘Muslim-migrant-terrorist’ i.e. Black or Brown and especially if they are from a Muslim majority country. Muslims, regardless of migration status, experience borders in daily life through a suspicion based on the Islamophobic assumption of their proximity to terrorism , and are always at risk of their citizenship being deprived. That is why an intersectional and anti-oppression approach is essential. It means acknowledging the role Islamophobia and counter-terrorism laws play in immigration legislation and challenging the construction of migrants from Muslim-majority countries as ‘threats’ to the UK.

Migrants' Rights Network,Digitisation of the UK border: EVisas,16-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/16/evisas-digitisation-of-the-border/,"As part of the Government’s strategy to fully digitise the UK border by 2025 , the Home Office is switching from physical immigration to documents to eVisas. This accompanies the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for visitors on short-term visas. Currently, digital status only exists for people on select visas, including the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and the Hong Kong BN(O) visa, but this will be expanded to all migrants, regardless of which visa they are on, by the end of 2024. How will this affect my proof of status? Instead of sharing physical visa documents, like a Biometric Residence Card or Permit, proof of status will be shown by signing in to the ‘View and Prove’ service. This service is also accessible if someone has a Certificate of Application for a certain visa route. In order to prove right to work or rent, people will be able to generate a share code, where an employer or landlord will be able to check the individual’s name, immigration status, and any dates or conditions for their visa’s validity. This is shared through View and Prove. What else changes? People will have to upload a new photo of themselves every 5 years if under 16 and every 10 years if 16 or older. The maximum age this needs to be updated is 70 years old. People will also have to update their photo if they think their appearance has changed significantly. This is self-judged. The updated image is automatically compared against and matched with the existing photo. If the images are not automatically matched by the Home Office’s system, then a manual check may have to be performed by a Home Office caseworker. How do I switch to an eVisa? The expansion will be rolled out throughout 2024, so you do not have to take any steps right now. The Home Office will release updates on when and how to register for an UKVI account. More information on eVisas can be found here . You can also find more of our work on the Digital Hostile Environment here ."
Migrants' Rights Network,Data-sharing and immigration enforcement,16-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/16/data-sharing-digital-hostile-environment/,"The Government is expanding data-sharing, within the Home Office, between Government departments, with private entities, like banks, and internationally. These developments are worrying, as they expand access to people’s personal and private data, bringing surveillance in our daily lives, including when accessing vital services like healthcare. Discrimination against migrants and migratised people is enshrined in data-sharing practices. Government guidance has emphasised that this is a form of legal discrimination on the basis of nationality and national or ethnic origin and implicit racial discrimination. This is in accordance with exceptions in Schedules 3 and 23 of the Equality Act 2010, which remove discrimination protections in relation to immigration law enforcement. We are particularly concerned about how data-sharing disproportionately impacts migrants and migratised people, especially those with precarious immigration status.  We are currently looking into these data-sharing agreements and how they are being implemented in order to challenge them. The financial sector The Home Office shares data with financial institutions, like banks and building societies, to prevent people with irregular status from having a bank account. The agreement with the financial sector is being restarted after it was paused in 2019 following the Windrush Scandal and the Government claims to have updated safeguards. The practice of ‘de-risking’ has also resulted in bank account closures as a result of policies around terrorism and “high-risk” countries that disproportionately affect minoritised groups. The expansion of these categories has resulted in civil servants, political figures, and activists being caught up in these practices. Third-party databases are often used in these decisions, where data collected on customers is passed onto banks. Reputational and compliance risk are overzealously applied on grounds of potential implications in terrorism and “politically-exposed persons”. These are vague and therefore subject to biases that link migratised and minoritised populations to terms like “terrorism”, for example if they were born in and send money to relatives in a country deemed to finance terrorism. This has resulted in a massive increase in account closures in recent years, which has impacted marginalised communities in particular. Data protection rules must be properly enforced under financial due diligence and compliance to prevent this. We are also concerned about the way that AI and machine learning are being integrated into this practice, further entrenching biases in decision-making and increasing wrongful closures. We are currently conducting research into how these practices are now taking place, including how they identify individuals. Home Office NHS Reference Number A tracking scheme where the NHS shared patients’ details with the Home Office was suspended in 2018 after a legal challenge from health and civil society groups, including MRN. Now, the Government has introduced new plans to assign Home Office reference numbers to migrants’ NHS files. Adding this reference number would not aid the NHS in identifying patients’ fee status, as they are already notified of who has paid the Immigration Health Surcharge, but would enable the Home Office to track migrants’ healthcare records. This comes after a previous scheme that used NHS data to track down patients allegedly breaching immigration rules was abandoned following a legal challenge pertaining to patient confidentiality, discrimination and deterring migrants from seeking care. The new plans will have the same effect: they immediately single out migratised patients, potentially deterring people from seeking treatment, as well as extending state surveillance over migratised populations’ entire lives. We have written to the Chief Executive of NHS England over this, and will continue to challenge the extension of the border into vital services like healthcare. Passports The Policing Minister recently said that he plans for passport data to be integrated into the Police National Database (PND) for facial recognition purposes in criminal investigations. For foreign nationals not on the passport database, this would be through the immigration and biometrics database. The use of these databases exacerbates the biases that already exist with facial recognition software, enabling further surveillance of racialised and migratised communities. It is important to note that Prevent data also goes on the PND, highlighting how arbitrary the criteria is to be placed on this database. This also shows the discriminatory foundations of the practice, as Prevent has been widely criticised as Islamophobic. Moves to integrate passport and visa biometrics databases into the PND are highly concerning. They expand surveillance over all of us through opaque means of mass data-sharing, harming migrants with precarious status in particular. International data-sharing There have been several developments in deals involving the sharing of data between the UK and EU. Most recently, the UK extension to the EU-US Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework came into effect in October 2023. Through this scheme, US companies can share personal data with the EU, and now the UK. The framework replaces a prior iteration, the Privacy Shield, that the European Court of Justice found contained inadequate safeguards against unlawful surveillance by US state agencies. While this replacement framework aims to fix this, the US has still failed to substantially change its surveillance laws. The UK extension to this comes amidst the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, which would allow for personal data from the UK to be shared with third countries, even when data protection for unlawful access from foreign authorities is inadequate. There are also two plans for data-sharing involving the EU for the purpose of tracking migrants’ movements through the continent using personal data: the EU Plan for International Data Sharing System and the soon to be announced EU-UK deal for Frontex to share data with UK Border Force. The former involves security-related data being shared between frontline EU forces, like Frontex, and key partner countries, strengthening internal security through new IT developments and expanding this in the future to non-member states. This includes a proposal to compare data stored under the Prüm Convention, containing national biometric, vehicle registration and police record databases, to “third country-sourced data”. The latter deal came out of the European Political Community summit in October. Frontex uses personal data from people travelling through Europe, such as from phones, to “map” migrants’ movements in real time. This deal would see this mapping data shared with the UK Border Force. Expanding data-sharing is worrying. The uses of and access to that data are often opaque, especially when private corporations are involved, and discriminatory, disproportionately affecting migratised and racialised communities and contributing to the excessive surveillance that they are subjected to. This is why we are committed to investigating how these data-sharing agreements are being implemented and raising awareness of this issue more broadly in how it affects our community.

Migrants' Rights Network,Suella’s horrendous legacy: her worst moments,13-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/13/suellas-worst-moments/,"Suella Braverman has been sacked as Home Secretary. Over the last year, she has headed up some of the most regressive immigration policies and made some inflammatory, divisive statements about marginalised groups. So, we thought we’d put together a short list of some of the most infamous moments: Her complicity in creating harmful anti-migrant laws and policies Whether it was her involvement in the ‘Illegal Migration’ Act, her proposals to deny citizenship to anyone with a criminal sentence of 12 months , or her obsession with “stopping the boats” , Suella’s commitment to demonising and violating the rights of migratised and racialised communities truly knew no bounds. When she called migrants an “invasion” and a “hurricane” Suella never shied away from scapegoating, whipping up hysteria, and fear mongering, as her “hurricane” comments showed. She had the audacity to claim migrants are an “invasion” when so many migrants are fleeing conflict and instability caused by the West’s colonial legacies and imperialism in Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. She clearly hadn’t heard of the famous quote “we are here because you were there”. Maybe now she has more time on her hands she could go educate herself. When she couldn’t stop dreaming about Rwanda We dream of a world without oppression. Suella dreams of a world where marginalised people are deported to Rwanda. Weird flex but OK. When she fangirled over the British Empire Suella has stated her “pride” for Britain’s colonial history, and that “those on the left are ashamed of our history” . We wonder how someone whose own family has fled the effects of colonialism could be so delusionally unashamed. When she attacked the Refugee Convention Appallingly yet unsurprisingly, the Home Secretary stated she wanted to abandon the 1951 Refugee Convention in favour of stricter measures to limit the eligibility for refugee protection . She believed that the Refugee Convention was not “fit for the modern age” because the threshold was too low. When in reality, the Refugee Convention is not fit for any age because the threshold is far too high. The reasons people flee are complex and numerous, including discrimination, economic instability and climate change, which are all threats to someone’s dignity and quality of life. How much harm is enough for you Suella? And if this wasn’t enough, she also went out of her way to state that people falsely claim they are gay in order to claim asylum. Let that sink in. When she took issue with migrants’ failure to “integrate” Suella expressed concern that migrants have failed to “integrate”. It’s bizarre that migrants should be expected to give up important elements of their identity in order to be respected. Instead of obsessing over how migrants can be forced to “integrate”, let’s dream of a world where migrants are celebrated and respected. When she said people chose to be unhoused She continued to prove how ridiculously out of touch she was when she tweeted that migrant rough sleepers dabble in rough sleeping as a “lifestyle choice”. No one chooses to be unhoused. Austerity policies and the UK’s racist immigration system force people to become unhoused. When she was obsessed with grooming gangs Suella made no secret of her obsession with the ethnicity of grooming gangs. She previously claimed in an interview with Sky News that grooming gang members are “almost all British-Pakistani” , despite Home Office statistics showing that group-based Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) offenders are most commonly White . This obsession also forms part of a long history of the Home Secretary’s demonisation of Muslim and racialised communities, who are often disproportionately affected by deprivation of citizenship. So called “hate marches” According to the Home Secretary, marching against ongoing settler-colonialism, genocide and ethnic cleansing is hateful ? Ok Suella. TLDR: Suella, you’re the threat And finally, who can forget when she called migrants an “existential challenge for the political and cultural institutions of the West”? She was obsessed with demonising migrants as a “threat”, drawing on the Great Replacement Theory (a White supremacist myth) in order to justify violence against them. In case it’s not abundantly clear, the actual threat to our collective society is racism and divisive rhetoric. Now as the new Home Secretary, James Cleverly, takes her place, we’re anxiously awaiting what his stance on immigration policies will be. We urge him to meet with migrants and ask them what changes they want to see. We hope his legacy won’t be following in his predecessor’s footsteps when it comes to demonising marginalised groups."
Migrants' Rights Network,Digitisation of the UK border: Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA),13-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/13/electronic-travel-authorisation-eta/,"As part of the UK Government’s plans to fully digitise the UK border by 2025, a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system will be introduced similar to the e-visa system in the USA and Canada. By the end of 2024, people who do not need a visa to enter the UK will need to have an ETA before they visit. This will impact millions of travellers. What is an ETA? An ETA is a digital permission to travel. The ETA scheme will apply to most visitors to the UK who do not need a visa for stays of less than six months, and who do not have any other immigration status prior to travelling. An ETA will cost £10 per applicant when the scheme opens for nationals from the Gulf states and Jordan, permit multiple journeys and will be valid for two years or until the holder’s passport expires – whichever is sooner. You can find more information on the upcoming changes by checking out the Home Office’s ETA Factsheet . When will the changes come into effect? The scheme will operate for nationals from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states and Jordan first. From 25th October 2023, Qatari nationals will be the first to use the scheme followed by nationals from Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia from 1 February 2024. These nationals will move from being visa nationals to non-visa nationals. This also means the Electronic Visa Waiver (EVW) will cease to operate once moved to the ETA scheme. A worldwide expansion of the scheme will happen throughout 2024. Despite Home Office communications strategies, it is highly likely many will be caught out by the current, and future, changes to the UK border. We know that digitisation of our immigration systems can lead to more issues, so please make sure you are prepared for these pending changes. The Home Office have created a video which aims to provide a quick overview of the ETA and who will need one. Check out our other work on the Digital Hostile Environment ."
Migrants' Rights Network,International Day Against Fascism + Antisemitism,09-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/09/international-day-against-fascism-and-antisemitism/,"Content warning- Antisemitic violence. 9 November marks the anniversary of the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, where the Nazis brutally killed and injured Jewish people, destroyed over 8000 Jewish homes and businesses, and rounded up 30,000 Jewish men to send to concentration camps. With the rise of far-right, fascist and neo-Nazi groups across Europe, we cannot afford to be indifferent. Indifference legitimises hatred, dehumanisation and eventually, can even pave the way for genocide. This International Day Against Fascism + Antisemitism, we stand firmly against hatred in all its forms. We want to honour the legacy of Jewish-led anti-fascist groups, most notably at the Battle of Cable Street (1936) and in the post-war 43 Group. And we see their legacy in those who continue to fight against the far-right and fascists who intimidate and threaten refugees. Antisemitism, racism and other forms of oppression are on the rise in the UK, and so the struggle against fascism is as important as ever. At a time when migrants and other marginalised groups are facing a sharp increase in hate, scapegoating, hostility and violence, we must stand resolutely against indifference. At MRN, we are committed to embedding anti-oppression in our work. We recognise that all struggles are interconnected. Justice for one cannot be achieved without justice for all."
Migrants' Rights Network,"Silent genocides: Congo, Armenia + Sudan",07-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/07/silent-genocides/,"As the world watches in horror at the atrocities in Palestine, we must acknowledge that too little attention has been paid to the genocides unfolding in other parts of the world: in Armenia, Congo and Sudan. At MRN, we will always speak up and use our platform to raise awareness of any situation where people are being forcibly displaced. To be silent is to uphold violence. We refuse to be complicit. Congo The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer the legacies of colonialism and imperial interventions. The Congolese people have been colonised, enslaved, murdered and systematically oppressed by Belgium to extract its resources. At least 10 million people died under Belgium’s rule. Even after Congo gained independence, Western governments and corporations have continued to intervene and create instability, so they can continue to extract raw minerals and wealth, such as uranium. Belgium and the USA were complicit in the murder of Congo’s anti-colonial independence leader, Patrice Lumumba, in 1961 , after which Mobutu Sese Seko was installed as dictator. Today, Congolese civilians are being massacred by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels , as part of a long history of Western and corporate intervention in the DRC. Western corporations profit from the mining of coltan, cobalt, gold, diamond and other minerals in the DRC , whilst the West (the UK, US and France) has been providing military funding to both Rwandan and Ugandan militias in Congo . The UK has also remained silent on Rwanda’s role in the violence, which is unsurprising given the Rwanda deportation deal. Since 1996, at least 6 million Congolese have died, and millions have been displaced and are suffering, so the West can continue to benefit from Congo’s resources , and access them for cheap rates . At MRN, we call for safe routes for all those affected, and for an end to Western corporate and government interference. Armenia As suffering and gross injustices in the Global South continue to be overlooked, we condemn the genocide against the Armenian people. Armenians have been ethnically cleansed and displaced as part of a genocide by Azerbaijan, with the backing of Turkey. Over 100,000 people have been forced to leave the area after facing months of blockades. No-one should be forced to leave their homes or be displaced, but when they are, we should be offering safe routes for those that want them. We call for an end to the occupation and genocide of the Armenian people in Artsakh. Sudan Since April this year, war has raged in Sudan between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), in the aftermath of a derailed revolution by the Sudanese people. Popular protests toppled the dictatorship of Omar Al-Bashir in 2019, which was followed by a military coup by the leaders of the SAF and RSF in 2021, who were working together at the time. But now, thousands have been killed and millions forced to flee as a result of a power struggle between the RSF and SAF, while the Sudanese people face untold atrocities, violence, starvation and disease at the hands of both factions . Over 9,000 have died, whilst at least 5 million have been displaced. The RSF continues to be funded by the UAE , whilst Israel has funded both factions . This power struggle has “disproportionately affected those already suffering under a continuing genocide in Darfur” . The UK Government and the West have failed the people of Sudan. In contrast to the safe routes it provided for Ukrainians, the UK has clearly demonstrated its indifference to the suffering of people from the Global South. Safe routes should be provided regardless of nationality or ethnicity. We have a duty to assist those who are suffering and to stand in solidarity with all oppressed people."
Migrants' Rights Network,Desensitisation to the Global Majority’s Suffering,03-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/03/desensitisation-to-global-majority-suffering/,"Media portrayals and imagery play a huge role in how we view certain groups of people. For years, so many of us have become accustomed to graphic images of suffering, war, shelling and starvation of people in the Global South. Despite the initial horror and outrage this can spark in our collective consciousness, it is only a matter of time before we become numb to these images. At MRN, we want to defy established narratives on migration and displacement. In all our campaigns, we try not to use images of people at their most vulnerable because we believe this erodes their agency and, most of the time, these photographs are taken without their consent. In 2015, the images of the death of Aylan Kurdi shocked the world and prompted outrage from media outlets, including anti-migrant publications. Across the political divide, people called for action and safe routes to avoid such a tragedy from happening again. However this compassion was short-lived and soon the divisive status quo resumed. This is trauma voyeurism. Trauma voyeurism exploits a person’s pain, suffering, body or misfortune for the purpose of viewing, sensationalism and entertainment. This is especially prevalent in the age of viral content and 24-hour news content. Humanitarian campaigns and media depictions have instilled in the West the ideas that make us associate Africa with starvation, or the Middle East with war and bombing. Ultimately, we become desensitised to their struggles and it becomes harder for us to empathise. On the other hand, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the steady stream of footage showing the exceptional, ‘unprecedented’ suffering of White Europeans grappling with things we associate with the Global South, horrified us. As a result, many states felt compelled to help and people across the West called for immediate action. As we speak, the world watches unphased as people in Palestine, Armenia, Sudan or the Congo suffer. How we relate to people matters because it has implications in policy. It is why the UK is happy to create safe routes for Ukrainians but not Sudanese people or Afghans. It is why we struggle to feel empathy for people forced into small boats or who have drowned in the Mediterranean. We need to rethink how we depict people, particularly in relation to the root causes of migration and displacement. Enacting a trauma-informed approach, tackling exploitative media practices and addressing power imbalances by actually giving people agency in how they should be depicted is essential.

Migrants' Rights Network,Islamophobia Awareness Month 2023,01-Nov-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/11/01/islamophobia-awareness-month-2023/,"The theme for this year’s Islamophobia Awareness Month is #MuslimStories. Muslim voices are incredibly important to amplify, especially given the rise in Islamophobic scapegoating. At MRN, we believe in the transformative power of storytelling, especially from Muslim communities who are affected by multiple systems of oppression, such as queer Muslims, Muslim asylum seekers, Black Muslims, disabled Muslims and Muslim women. If you have a story that you would like to share, about navigating your identity as a Muslim migrant or migratised person, please get in touch by emailing [email protected]"
Migrants' Rights Network,Blog: Bibby Stockholm,30-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/30/blog-bibby-stockholm/,"The thought of being moved to Bibby Stockholm is very frightening. My life stops for a moment to process the possibility of being accommodated in a three-storey vessel. As an asylum seeker, I’ve become well aware of the Home Office’s treatment, similar to the proverb of beggars, ‘beggars are not choosers’. Regrettably, I now understand what it actually means. It’s not as if I have the luxury of refusing this development; the Home Office’s stance is clear – if an asylum seeker dares to resist the relocation, they’re promptly relocated out of their current temporary accommodation. The concept of choosing where to live as an asylum seeker seems unrealistic but the Government’s approach to accommodate asylum seekers on the barge and in tents falls short of the intrinsic dignity of individuals seeking safety. The voice of asylum seekers in matters of accommodation ought to be considered and respected. After all, the journey to safety is often treacherous, and it’s disheartening to think that our voices are suppressed even when it comes to something as basic as where we lay our heads. In the same vein, the Government should be keen to receive inputs on what safe routes  should look like from those who’ve arrived in the UK through unconventional routes. Only when that happens would we witness a monumental shift towards a more empathetic approach. Those of us who have navigated unfamiliar landscapes and endured traumatic experiences undoubtedly hold valuable insights that could contribute to shaping safer routes for upcoming asylum seekers. It’s only logical that the authorities engage a meaningful dialogue with those who’ve faced the most perilous of journeys to inform the creation of pathways that truly uphold the value of human life and dignity. Yet, the reality on the ground paints a different picture. The UK Government’s approach seems to deliberately create a challenging and unwelcoming atmosphere for asylum seekers. We, who are fleeing life-threatening conditions in our homelands, encounter not just the harshness of an unfamiliar land, but also the intricate web of barriers and uncertainties that are designed to magnify our vulnerability. The issue of accommodation adds an additional layer of hardship to the already challenging journey of seeking asylum. The choice of Bibby Stockholm, a barge, as accommodation for asylum seekers despite widespread criticism, shows the shortcomings of the system. In addition to the obvious lack of basic facilities for dignified living, it contributes to the poor mental and emotional well-being among those seeking safety. Being put in such a space, cut off from a community setting, only amplifies our sense of isolation and despair. As we persist in navigating this challenging journey in pursuit of safety and security, I hold onto the aspiration that the UK government can move beyond its current stance. An asylum seeker’s story is not merely one of survival; it’s a testament to resilience, courage, and the enduring human spirit. It’s a narrative that deserves to be heard, acknowledged, and respected – especially when it comes to decisions as crucial as accommodation and safe passage. The journey is long, the challenges are vast, but the human potential for empathy, understanding, and change is boundless."
Migrants' Rights Network,“We are pioneers and innovators”.,27-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/27/bhm2023-we-are-pioneers/,"Being in community Every year, I take my children to the Black History Month celebrations in Borehamwood, Stevenage in Hertfordshire. There are so many different African flags and markets, and many small businesses selling clothes, fruits, books, pieces of art, clothing, Black skincare products, and various other things. Black writers and film producers are also showcased. There are also book launches, and immigration advice is also given to those who want to know more about their rights or renew their passports. Celebrating our heritage is about celebrating it together: in community with one another. Sharing our voice When I came to this country as a teenager from Nigeria, I knew straight away that I was an immigrant. It was not an easy journey: I felt like I didn’t have a platform to speak or fight. Racism was embedded in every institution, and still is. I began to realise the importance of Black History Month: it is a platform for us to come together and share our voices. It allows our voices, our values, our celebrations, and our pride to be heard by the world. What use are our voices if they are not even heard? This is why Black History being taught in schools is so important. We need to be represented, in our totality and fullness, and the voices of our ancestors must be amplified and heard. This is also why migration charities must also be talking about Black History Month: to ensure that our voices are heard by those in power. Charities need to stop shutting our voices down, or assuming that they know best. This is White saviourism. Do not forget You only know who you are when you understand where you have come from. Darcus Howe The theme for 2023 is “celebrating our sisters”, which is about honouring the vital role Black women have played in history: from literature, art and culture, to music, politics and healthcare. Black women have always been underappreciated and are often not given the credit they deserve. Our achievements as Black people are often appropriated. The world must celebrate Black women, sing our praises, and give us our flowers. But we must celebrate ourselves first. If we don’t celebrate ourselves first, then no-one else will. It is really important to me, as a Black woman, to celebrate, appreciate and honour my heritage, and to remember our ancestors who fought for the life we live today. Our ancestors must live forever and for generations to come- we must not forget them. Black history is history for us all. If we forget our past, where we come from, then nothing will be left for the future. Looking to the future People have dismissed Africa and its people, constantly saying that nothing good comes out of our continent. But we are pioneers and innovators: whether it be Afrobeat music, or films like The Woman King or Wakanda. I am constantly inspired by Black innovation. Our power to innovate is incredible, and we can use it to inspire, and to create the kind of future that we want for the generations to come. I want a future where Black people can collaborate and trade freely with each other. Where our countries are not plunged into further debts by the West. Where we are economically empowered. Where our stolen and looted wealth is returned to us by those who colonised us. I wish for a future where we are free to embrace and celebrate our heritage fully. Where we are able to excel without fear, and not be hindered or limited by systemic oppression or other people’s perceptions of us. Where Black History Month is every month. We don’t need to wait for October to celebrate, we can celebrate our Blackness every day. We have to be hopeful. We have to imagine and plan the future that we want, open our minds to it, and move towards it. We need to look behind us, to know where we are coming from, so that we know where we want to go. We must think about our roots and our struggles, and take lessons from the past, but we must also not entrap ourselves into only looking backwards. We cannot allow ourselves to become trapped by hopelessness or internalise the oppressor’s narrative: that we are destined for or only worthy of the bare minimum. We must look forward too. We must imagine and innovate our way out of this unjust present, into a just future."
Migrants' Rights Network,“We made ourselves strong”.,26-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/26/bhm2023-we-made-ourselves-strong/,"Until the lion learns how to write, every story will glorify the hunter. African Proverb. Who’s history? When we speak of history, who’s history are we talking about? When I think about history, I see clear bias. It is not an objective recounting of events, but rather a narrative of Whiteness. Black History Month allows us to correct that bias. To know our present, we have to know our history. And once we know our history, and what work still needs to be done, we can better understand the future and what we want from it. To know where you are going, you have to know where you come from. We are not homogeneous I came to the UK at the age of 7, as a refugee from a rural village in Uganda. My experience as a Black woman and a Ugandan refugee has shaped my understanding of the world, but I cannot claim to speak for or be representative of all Black people nor refugees, or that my words will resonate with all Black people. We are not homogeneous, and we contain multitudes: every Black person has their own story, their own starting point, and their own experiences with class, gender, ability, religion and sexuality, which go on to shape their worldviews. Black History Month should elevate the vast and diverse experiences of Black people, and make space for all of us. Being a Black child in a majority White school was difficult. Once I arrived in the UK, I could feel injustice all around me, without even knowing the word for it. The education of Black history in school was inadequate, and growing up, I remember charities engaging in White saviourism, and poverty and trauma voyeurism. I only became aware of Black History Month as an adult. Black History Month allows me to see individuals who look like me and who share similar stories. Hearing people and listening to their stories is empowering, and also defies the distorted narrative of history that we have been fed. Celebrating our sisters As a Black woman, the theme of this year’s Black History Month is so important to me. As Black women, we are held to a higher standard than most, expected to work twice as hard, expected to expend huge amounts of emotional labour, and expected to sacrifice our personal needs and desires for the comfort of everyone else. I have found myself constantly playing the role of sister, mother and therapist. Black women are expected to tolerate pain, to coddle most individuals, and to be the support system for everyone else. We shouldn’t have to be strong, or resilient. But we are strong, not because our struggles made us strong, but in spite of them. We are strong because we made ourselves strong. We are strong, but we are also vulnerable, and we deserve space to be vulnerable. For me, sisterhood also transcends race. I am part of a beautiful community of amazing women from various backgrounds. We celebrate each other’s strength, but we also support each other, and give each other the space to be vulnerable. The support is reciprocated, as it should be, and the burden doesn’t fall on me as a Black woman to constantly provide comfort. I deserve to put my own needs first, and the community I am a part of honours that. Black Joy As important as Black History Month is, the way that various institutions attempt to celebrate it feels very rushed, forced and uncomfortable. It feels performative and saviourist. What changes are actually being made after October ends? What work is being done throughout the year to elevate Black voices and challenge anti-Blackness? The effort should be constant and long-term, not just during Black History Month. The way that institutions attempt to celebrate Black History Month also strikes me as exploitative. Our trauma becomes something to be consumed, and sometimes it seems that institutions thrive off of our trauma. This feels heavy to witness. There is much emphasis on our pain, struggles, hardships and resilience, but barely any attempts are made to amplify and celebrate our joy. Our history does not begin with enslavement. It would be good for institutions such as schools to recognise the richness and diversity of Black African History prior to this moment. What we are taught in school shapes our psyches growing up. If we are only taught about pain, how does this leave us feeling? If we are only taught about joy, how will our struggle be acknowledged? There needs to be a balance between acknowledging Black pain and elevating Black joy. The fullness of our humanity must be respected: we are not reducible to our trauma. Nor are we reducible to the elements of our culture that society has appropriated for aesthetics. Being a refugee The difficulties I faced in my childhood make me want to continue to support those who are marginalised. And my own experience of displacement has made me realise how important it is for British migration charities to celebrate Black History Month, and to honour Black voices through ethical storytelling that affirms our humanity. Nonconsensual images and videos of suffering and impoverished Black people have dominated the charity landscape for years. These kinds of images affect the way that society views us, so much so that when I was a child, a teacher asked me if I also used to have flies on my mouth, like the children in the videos. Most of my youth consisted of educating classrooms, due to these imbalanced narratives. Growing up, I never felt truly seen. These kinds of images are dehumanising, since they turn our trauma into a spectacle, and present us as passive victims with little to no agency. I am not a victim, nor have I ever seen myself as one. The future Our future is defined on what we are doing now. If we do it right, we will have a brighter future. We cannot look at the future in isolation. The past has an impact on how we feel and act today, and our actions today affect tomorrow. I wake up every morning listening to motivational talks. Even during hard moments, I remind myself of the beautiful things in life, such as slowing down, resting, connecting with nature and community. During difficult times, I remind myself that when I was a child, I didn’t even know if I would survive the night. This grounds me in the present moment, and makes me appreciate what I have access to, and to make the most of it. I know that so many people out there can only dream of my reality, and I am reminded to see life through their perspective. I truly believe that the world needs more empathy. My upbringing has allowed me to see how important it is to have a community of loved ones around you who support and uplift you, and make space for you to be your authentic self. We are all connected and in community. We can use what we have access to in order to stand with others we are in community with. In the words of Maya Angelou: “ I come as one but stand as 10,000 ”."
Migrants' Rights Network,“Celebrating our Blackness in its entirety”.,24-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/24/bhm2023-celebrating-our-blackness/,"We were all Black Malawi is known for its humility and compassion, and as the “warm heart of Africa”. As someone from Malawi, I celebrate my Blackness and Black history in the UK through sharing my culture with those around me. I am part of the Ngoni tribe, which is one of the oldest tribes in Africa. It is one of the tribes that helped in the liberation fight against the British colonists. We have a rich culinary and music tradition. When I lived in Malawi, I would watch the news, and I would wonder why people abroad were so obsessed with race. Back home, we were all Black: we were a homogenous race. We celebrated our Blackness by celebrating our specific Malawian cultures: our food, our dress and our languages. We didn’t experience anti-Black racism. But when I arrived in the UK, I began to experience other people’s perceptions of my Blackness, and the oppression and microaggressions that came with it. People would cross the road when they saw me, and treat me like an “invader” that doesn’t deserve to be here. I realised that racism was an extremely important conversation, since it implicates every facet of our lives. And I began to understand the immense importance of Black History Month. Black Remembrance Black History Month is about remembrance. It is a celebration and reflection of the past, of the achievements and struggles of Black people. It elevates the voices and stories of those who have been silenced and have fought for freedom, in order to challenge the omissions, erasure and distortion of our history. But it also involves an understanding of how the past informs our current reality, and how history shapes what we want from the future. Our Sisters This year, Black History Month encourages us to celebrate, honour, and spotlight our sisters, their achievements and their struggles, including their fight against misogynoir. Colourism is something that affects Black women in uniquely devastating ways. Light-skinned Black women are perceived to be more beautiful and more worthy than darker-skinned Black women. Unfortunately, many darker-skinned Black women bleach their skin because of colourism. Colourism is in fact a legacy of the enslavement of Black people. It is important that we unite against anti-Black racism, but also colourism. I often think about the situation of women and girls in Malawi, and there are sadly many patriarchal elements to our culture. Patriarchy is universal, and it manifests itself differently in different contexts. In Malawi, it looks like the expectation of women as housewives, or sadly child marriage: many families who are impoverished will marry off their daughters in order to receive a dowry. In Malawi, there is also a massive issue of period poverty, which means that girls will often miss out on school. The unaffordability of period products and the lack of access to menstrual facilities in schools is a barrier towards girls’ education and negatively impacts their academic performance. When I lived in Malawi, I was a part of the SIC’s (Sanitation Innovations Center) initiative to challenge period poverty . The project taught young people how to create reusable period pads out of locally accessible materials: the waterproof packaging from Malawian sugar can be sewn in between the fleece from unused blankets in order to create a DIY pad. When we reflect on our history, it is important to reflect on where we are, and also on where we want to be: no woman or girl should be denied access to education. We must celebrate the achievements of our Black sisters, not just our cisters . We can see the massive impact of Black trans women, including Marsha P Johnson, in the Stonewall revolution, and their crucial role in securing rights for the queer community. We must also honour the queer Black communities who resist the colonial legacies of anti-gay laws in the African continent, and the queer Black History that has been erased, including in Malawi. Black Migration It is imperative that people understand the interconnectedness of Blackness and migration. Migration has been part of human history for a long time, and the Black experience especially is intrinsically linked to forced migration, and the millions displaced through enslavement and colonialism. When Black asylum seekers and refugees flee to the UK, they experience the violence of racist, Islamophobic and anti-migrant immigration policies. Their displacement, as well as the displacement of people from the Global South more generally, is directly linked to colonial legacies such as poverty, war and conflict. There is also much to be said about the way that Black and Brown asylum seekers are often disbelieved, and their asylum claims are rejected as not being “genuine”, simply on account of their skin tone. I want to learn more about the struggles that Black people face in the UK. Whilst I don’t mind being asked where I am from, I understand that for Black people raised here, that question just reinforces how they will never belong. Anger + joy As a Black migrant, to me Blackness means not belonging. It means that no matter how hard you try, this is not your home. But it also means resilience, strength, beauty and love. History affects the present, and the structural racism that we have experienced and continue to experience does impact our daily lives in a multitude of ways in terms of educational attainment, career prospects and health outcomes. But I am also not a victim. I refuse the victim mentality, because we are not inherently hopeless, passive victims. Something that we do have agency and control over is being unapologetic and hopeful in our Black joy and our roots, but also in our unwavering focus on a future world free from oppression. Our anger at our unjust history and present can be channelled into hope towards the future. Black History Month is about bringing people together in the pursuit of liberation. It is about anti-imperialism and ensuring the total independence of African countries, and their freedom from colonial control. It is about reparations, education and correcting the omissions of history. It is about positive representation by Black people in policy-making. We need representation by those who have the best interests of our community at heart, not those who pander to scapegoating. Representation is about celebrating our Blackness in its entirety, and refusing to assimilate to or imitate Whiteness, or be used as pawns and agents of Empire. We must refuse to eradicate the very fibres that make us who we are. The Black struggle is the bedrock of all other struggles. Let’s be proud of it."
Migrants' Rights Network,Right to Work Checks + Immigration Raids,23-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/23/immigration-raids-right-to-work/,"Immigration raids incite fear in migrant and migratised communities, while right to work guidance is causing confusion amongst employers. Through both our Hostile Office and Challenge the Checks campaigns, we are looking at how different aspects of legislation such as employment, digital and immigration law clash to create misery for migrant workers. The Government signalled an increase in immigration enforcement raids at the end of 2022 as part of its increasingly regressive stance on immigration. The Home Office established the UK’s first cross-Government ministerial taskforce on immigration enforcement which aims to reduce ‘illegal working’ and employment and “ensure only those eligible can work.” In August 2023, the Home Office announced that civil penalties for employers found to be employing workers without permission to work are to triple. The announcement signified the biggest rise in civil penalties since 2014, rising from £15,000 to £45,000 per worker and up to £60,000 for repeat breaches. Since the start of 2018, around 5,000 penalties have been issued to employers totalling £88.4 million. In just the second quarter of 2023, 377 were issued totalling £5.6 million in value whilst in the first quarter of the year, civil penalties amounted to £6 million. Evidently, immigration raids on workplaces are a highly lucrative income stream for the Home Office. Source: Immigration Enforcement data: Q2 2023 Upon the announcement of the increase in civil penalties, the Home Office stated that in order to avoid a fine, the employer needs to carry out a right to work check and that it “takes only 5 minutes”. However, our Challenge the Checks research has found that right to work guidance is confusing, contradictory and in many cases, the checks simply do not work. For example, the guidance itself states “it will not be possible to conduct a Home Office online right-to-work check in all circumstances, as not all individuals will have an immigration status that can be checked online”. While those who obtained Indefinite Leave to Remain before November 2008 have no digital footprint. Right to work checks are complex and many employers don’t understand the rules. As a result, migrant workers are suffering. Through our Challenge the Checks campaign and Hostile Office campaign, we are committed to exposing the impact of the hostile environment in the workplace. We are raising awareness of the: Impact of immigration raids on migrant and migratised communities How immigration raids are affecting migrant and racialised businesses Contradictions in the overly complex right to work guidance, civil penalties and the impact this is having on migrant workers Technical issues with platforms such as share code error sharing, discrimination from facial recognition software and workers being asked to pay for them Outsourcing of right to work services to third-party providers Right to work checks are broken. Immigration raids are discriminatory. We are calling for right to work checks and raids to stop.

Migrants' Rights Network,MAP: Second Workshop,21-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/21/map-second-workshop/,"On the second day of the workshops, which took place on October 21, 2023, our participants had the privilege of learning from two remarkable speakers, Marzia Babakarkhail and Lara Parizotto, who shared their experiences and wisdom, guiding our fellows towards impactful leadership and personal aspiration. Marzia Babakarkhail, a former Supreme Court Judge from Afghanistan and an advocate for women’s rights, delivered an enlightening talk on “Leadership and Creative Change”. In this workshop, our fellows were exposed to the inspiring journeys of leaders who have taken action to empower migrants. Marzia emphasised the importance of leadership and how our unique experiences can be leveraged to help us become leaders in our own right. The session explored key skills necessary for success and provided invaluable insights into creating systemic change within UK society. Marzia’s own experience as a refugee and her continuous dedication to gender equality and human rights served as a powerful example of the potential impact one can have on the world. In the second workshop of the day, Lara Parizotto, a dedicated migrants’ rights campaigner, led a session titled “Sharing Your Own Aspiration”. Participants were encouraged to delve into their own passions and aspirations, understanding what drives them to make a difference. Lara’s interactive session allowed our fellows to take ownership of their aspirations and recognise their significance in raising awareness about the challenges facing our communities. Through engaging discussions and practical guidance, attendees discovered pathways to become public actors in various sectors, be it voluntary, community, NGO, public policy, civil service, or politics. Marzia and Lara both come from countries marked by humanitarian crises and have experienced challenges as recent migrants in the UK. By sharing their journeys, they not only inspired our participants but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the broader migrant experience beyond the context of Hong Kong. Marzia’s extensive legal and advocacy background in promoting gender equality and human rights, coupled with her ongoing activism, highlighted the immense impact one person can have in advocating for positive change. Lara’s commitment to migrants’ rights, her work as a councillor, and her experiences in engaging with young people and changing the narrative on immigration showcased the power of personal passion and advocacy. These workshops were a powerful continuation of the Migrants’ Aspiration Programme, providing our participants with the tools, inspiration, and knowledge to pursue their goals and make lasting impact on UK society. Some fellows are impressed and deeply moved by Marzia’s perseverance and resilience as well as her work on women’s empowerment and gender equality, while many are also intrigued about the potential collaboration with Migrants Democracy Project (MDP). Our fellows show strong interest in the MPower Political Leadership Programme, and Lara has also offered to help Hongkongers campaign on civic education.

Migrants' Rights Network,Stop Appeasing Your Racist Uncle,11-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/11/stop-appeasing-your-racist-uncle/,"“In my day…” “It’s just a bit of banter.” “You can’t say anything these days!” “It’s political correctness gone mad.” We have undoubtedly heard these comments from older people in our lives. People of a certain age or generation, perhaps a neighbour, relative or family friend, who come out with problematic or bigoted comments. They’ll usually blame their age or make some passing comment that “in their day” things were different or those comments were acceptable (newsflash grandma: just because it was acceptable it doesn’t mean it was morally right!). Society often excuses them and holds up its hands saying “well what can we do, that’s just how they are.” Social norms have dictated that it’s normal to have a bigoted uncle or grandma. But why is this seen to be acceptable? These narrow-minded ideas often relate to the idea that political correctness, abolition or anti-oppression are new, and that anti-racism or critiques of the gender binary are modern ideas. However, many movements have been campaigning for justice for decades (or centuries). Movements for justice are perhaps only more visible now because of modern-day media cycles which fixate on certain issues. This media fixation is often a deliberate attempt to actually undermine these struggles (take the current anti-transphobic rhetoric that has taken hold of our political discourse). We must also remember that for many marginalised people in the past, it was not safe for them to speak up and be visibly engaged in justice movements, or perhaps they simply did not have the platform nor resources to do so. We have a collective responsibility to call out hatred and harmful rhetoric. To not do so is to be complicit, and allow these ideas to continue to permeate through our communities. At what age do we see someone as being beyond educating, or their bigotry as excusable? Insinuating that someone is too old to learn is ageism. Many older people continue to learn from and listen to marginalised groups. This kind of ageism also discredits all the older people who continue to fight for social justice and are on the front line of anti-oppressive movements. It diminishes the solidarity of the older generations who come out early in the morning to defend drag queen story time from fascists. You are never too old to be held to account. Racism (or any other form of discrimination) was never and will never be okay. Stop making excuses for it.

Migrants' Rights Network,World Mental Health Day,10-Oct-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/10/10/world-mental-health-day-2023/,"This year’s World Mental Health Day theme is ‘mental health is a universal human right’. That’s why we want to shine a light on the specific issues migrants, including refugees, face in relation to mental health. Looking at the intersections of immigration status with other aspects of identity is integral to our campaigning and policy work at MRN. We have found that the intersections of ableism around mental health and migration status have been overlooked, which is especially concerning in light of increasing reports of mental distress and abuse in immigration detention. Therefore, we want to use this day to bring attention to the complex needs and experiences of migrants in relation to mental health. Disability and mental health A significant part of disability – any long-term condition concerning physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment(s) –  is mental health, encompassing both permanent and more temporary conditions. The less visible nature of mental health has meant that ableism on these grounds is often ignored. Mental health is a core issue for migrants with disabilities, as many suffer from PTSD after traumatic experiences in their origin country and/or from their journey to the UK. This can be intensified in immigration detention and Home Office accommodation in the UK; our community have told us rates of loneliness and isolation are high, along with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Uncertainty and an increasingly hostile atmosphere in the UK are exacerbated by the treatment of asylum seekers by the contracted accommodation staff. The hostility that many migrants, including refugees, are met with in Britain can be disabling in (re)traumatising people and negatively affecting rehabilitation. Talking about mental health requires more than simply raising awareness of the fact that many people, at some point in their lives, will experience some form of mental health condition. We want to explore the barriers to accessing essential mental health support services for migrants with disabilities. Accessing mental health support Most migrants are not entitled to free NHS healthcare, including mental health support services. The underfunding of NHS mental health services can also mean this may be hard to access or receive quality care that speaks to the specific experiences of displaced people. NGOs may provide similar services for torture survivors, but are limited in their resources. Further, undocumented migrants, those on short-term visas and refused asylum seekers do not have free access to healthcare, including psychiatric treatment, and face upfront charges of 150% of the cost of providing that care. The combination of stigma and fear of a mental health diagnosis negatively impacting asylum applications means that many do not access mental health support or declare mental health issues. Anecdotal evidence shows that asylum seekers with both physical and mental disabilities are common, which may lead to a physical disability being recognised and treated/accommodated, but not a mental health condition. For some , the isolation they feel as asylum seekers with physical disabilities has brought on or exacerbated mental health problems. Their inability to access assistive services, as a result of a lack of awareness of how to access  these services or their disabilities providing a barrier to actively seeking out/accessing these services means that they receive insufficient aid with their conditions, which often contribute to their mental health issues. Additionally, over 61% of asylum seekers experience serious mental distress. This is as a result of trauma from torture, war and persecution in their countries of origin, as well as from the asylum system in Britain, where isolation, poor housing and the experiences of making their claim significantly negatively affect their mental health. The role of the asylum process in causing mental ill-health makes it increasingly unlikely that asylum seekers would feel comfortable seeking support from similar state services. The Hostile Environment exacerbates mental health issues Mental health issues are often exacerbated by the conditions of immigration detention and asylum accommodation. The use of former military sites, with ex-military personnel acting as security, high barbed wire gates, extensive CCTV and the difficulties of leaving asylum accommodation sites leave people feeling isolated. Asylum accommodation is unsuitable for torture and trafficking survivors, as well as people with other mental health needs, but the lack of suitable assessment and screening processes means that there are people still placed in these damaging and unsafe conditions. The mental health effects of the isolation of migrants is likely to increase as the UK Government moves to expand the detention state. In order to ensure that mental health is recognised and protected as a universal human right, we call for an end to border violence and immigration detention. Systems of oppression, such as racism, queerphobia, transphobia, and ableism exacerbate mental ill-health, as well as in immigration detention and other modes of bordering, which can further intensify the harm of these systems. The denial of social and economic rights fundamental to the Hostile Environment, including the denial of safe and decent housing, poverty, combined with the lack of access to mental health support, is itself an extreme mental burden. The Government must end the state-sanctioned oppression of migrants, in immigration detention and anywhere else where the border exists. This includes ending the surveillance of migratised, racialised and queer communities, investing in public services, such as housing and healthcare, and ensuring that those services are free to access, regardless of migration status. This is especially urgent as mental distress and barriers to access care will be heightened for migrants placed at risk of being sent to detention centres in Rwanda, and many more made more precarious by the Inhumane Migration Act. Ableism and disability advocacy are often ignored, particularly in how it relates to navigating the immigration system and deconstructing the idea of who is welcome in the UK. At MRN, we will continue to explore the relationship between disability and migration through our key strategic objective to defy the existing narratives around migration. I believe that mental health is indeed a universal human right and any issues surrounding it should be taken with caution. As an asylum seeker, for me this day is not only about raising awareness but a call for urgent and compassionate interventions for asylum seekers and refugees. I have come to realise that we (asylum seekers) have a complex range of health needs that develop prior to leaving our country of origin, during transit or after arrival in the UK. Sadly, most of us are not aware that we need mental health help. This is so because we sometimes mistakenly believe that once we reach a place of safety, our mental health problems will magically disappear. But this is not the case. Being faced with a hostile environment, social exclusion, poor living conditions, destitution and long waiting period due to the deliberate backlog, often exacerbates our existing trauma for a second chance at life, plunging us into a relentless cycle of suffering. On this day, let’s advocate for a multifaceted approach that encompasses cultural sensitivity, equitable access to mental health services, and a society free from oppression and discrimination. Stop incarcerating asylum seekers after experiencing a mental breakdown/episode! Instead get them the treatment and support they require.

Migrants' Rights Network,Black History Month 2023,30-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/30/black-history-month/,"This Black History Month, we honour the work, resilience and creativity of incredible Black thinkers, activists and theorists in the UK and beyond. We are endlessly appreciative of their knowledge, as it has taught us not only how to make sense of our current world, but to imagine a new one free from oppression. This month, we want to highlight quotes by incredible Black thinkers, touching on themes such as Whiteness, abolition, migration, Black joy, divide and rule, and the erasure of Black history. Intersectionality and anti-oppression drives our work at MRN. We cannot understand migration without understanding histories of race and racism, specifically the ways that Black people have been dehumanised and constructed as “threats” to the nation. Black History Month is a celebration of all the important work that has been done, but is also a reminder of all the work we need to do to stand in solidarity with Black communities and dismantle systemic racism in all its forms. Whiteness Whiteness has always functioned as a tool of domination. Akala in his book Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire (Two Roads Publishers, 2019) The true focus of revolutionary change is never merely the oppressive situations which we seek to escape, but that piece of the oppressor which is planted deep within each of us…Revolution is not a one time event. Audre Lorde in her book Sister Outsider (Crossing Press, 1984) . The psychosis of Whiteness is not reserved for White people, it is a distortion that is rooted in Western society and can be reproduced by those of any hue. Thus is the power of the psychosis…Western capitalism is built on and sustained by a system of racism that exploits the people and nations of the darker parts of the globe. It is also sustained by a series of myths of progress and enlightenment about the good that the West has wrought. The dissonance between the reality and these myths is too great for the system to survive, so Whiteness becomes a psychosis that prevents society from engaging in the disturbing reality. This psychosis of Whiteness is essential to understand when fighting racism. There is no rational argument to those trapped in a psychosis, as there is no reasoning with Whiteness. Until the conditions that create Whiteness are destroyed, the psychosis will govern the thoughts and actions of Western society. Kehinde Andrews in his book The Psychosis of Whiteness: Surviving the Insanity of a Racist World (Allen Lane Publishers, 2023) . When we revolt it’s not for a particular culture. We revolt simply because, for many reasons, we can no longer breathe. Slogan adapted from Frantz Fanon ’s quote “It is not because the Indo-Chinese bas discovered a culture of his own that he is in revolt. It is because quite simply.. it was, in more than one way, becoming impossible for him to breathe” in his book Black Skin, White Masks (Penguin Classics, 2021) . There is no English history without that other history. Stuart Hall in Chapter 2 of his book Essential Essays, Volume 2: Identity and Diaspora (Duke University Press, 2018) . Black history is a series of missing chapters from British history. David Olusoga in Arifa Akbar’s “David Olusoga: ‘There’s a dark side to British history, and we saw a flash of it this summer’” (The Guardian, November 2016) . Not seeing race does little to dismantle racist structures or improve the lives of people of colour. In order to do so, we must see race. We must see who benefits from their race, who is affected by negative stereotyping of theirs, and on whom power and privilege is bestowed – not just because of their race, but also their class and gender. Seeing race is essential. Reni Eddo-Lodge in her book Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race (Bloomsbury Publishers, 2018) . We are socialised into systems that cause us to conform and believe our worth is connected to how much we can produce. Our constant labour becomes a prison that allows us to be disembodied. We become easy for the systems to manipulate, disconnected from our power as divine beings and hopeless. We forget how to dream. This is how grind culture continues. We internalise the lies and in turn become agents of an unsustainable way of living. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). Divide and rule Amnesia implies a passivity, a condition subconsciously visited upon the unwilling forgetter. With Britain’s racial past we witness something far more active, conscious and deliberate. The forgetting doesn’t simply happen to us; we are at great pains to make it happen for everybody. Gary Younge in his article “Lest we remember: How Britain buried its history of slavery” (The Guardian, March 2023) . “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing”. Malcolm X . The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. Audre Lorde at “The Personal and the Political” Panel during the Second Sex Conference (October 29, 1979) . We have to talk about liberating minds as well as liberating society . Angela Davis . White people love playing ‘divide and rule’. We should not play their game. Diane Abbott on Twitter in January 2012. The concept of laziness is a tool of the oppressor. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). So here’s my experience of growing up in Britain; it was always a case of making sure that I was grateful. Musa Okwonga in his article “The Ungrateful Country” (Byline Times, April 2020). Loving ourselves and each other deepens our disruption of the dominant systems. They want us unwell, fearful, exhausted, and without deep self-love because you are easier to manipulate when you are distracted by what is not real or true. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). Imagination This planet is for everyone, borders are for no one. Benjamin Zephaniah in his novel Refugee Boy (Bloomsbury Publishers, 2017) . Imagination is one of the most powerful modes of resistance that oppressed and exploited folks can use. bell hooks in Tricia Hersey’s Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022) . In predominantly white countries, it’s easy for us to forget that we are part of the global majority, that we are connected to billions of people across the world whose dreams for and actions toward liberation align with our own. Lady Phyll in “5 Global LGBTQ+ Leaders you Should Know About this Pride Month” (Equality Now, June 2021) . In one way or another, we all transition. Munroe Bergdorf in her book Transitional (Bloomsbury Publishers, 2023) . A people’s art is the genesis of their freedom. Claudia Jones in her article “A people’s art is the genesis of their freedom” (West Indian Gazette, 1960). Survival is not the end goal for liberation. We must thrive. We must rest. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). We struggle and fight for our joy – an unreserved and unapologetic joy that springs from our ability to live as we are. It’s a joy worth fighting for and it’s this joy that links all of our struggles together. Lady Phyll in her letter “No amount of bullying, racism, sexism or misogyny will hold us back” (Gay Times, October 2018) . Begin by thinking of love as an action rather than a feeling. bell hooks in her book all about love: new visions (HarperCollins Publishers, 2016) . Abolition Abolition is not primarily a negative strategy. It’s not primarily about dismantling, getting rid of, but it’s about re-envisioning. It’s about building anew. Angela Davis in “Angela Davis on Abolition, Calls to Defund Police, Toppled Racist Statues & Voting in 2020 Election” (Democracy Now, June 2020) . Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare. Audre Lorde in her book A Burst of Light: and Other Essays (Dover Publications, 2017) . Nobody’s free until everybody’s free. Fannie Lou Hamer in her speech delivered at the Founding of the National Women’s Political Caucus in Washington DC (10 July 1971). It’s a collective struggle and your struggle must be my struggle and my struggle must be yours. Lady Phyll in Kirsty Osei-Bempong’s “gal-dem in conversation with Lady Phyll, director of Black Pride UK” (galdem, June 2016). No pride for some of us without liberation for all of us . Attributable to Marsha P Johnson with the consent of the person who coined the phrase. We must believe we are worthy of rest. We don’t have to earn it. It is our birthright. It is one of our most ancient and primal needs. Tricia Hersey in her book Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto (Little Brown Spark Publishers, 2022). The moment we choose to love we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others. bell hooks in her book Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations (Routledge Publishers, 2006) .

Migrants' Rights Network,Identity Trouble: how stereotypes inform Chinese immigrant identification,29-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/29/identity-trouble-chinese-immigrant-identification/,"My different names When I moved to London two years ago, I lived in student accommodation. Communal spaces became a natural place to socialise. I usually use my English name with random strangers I meet first, as I prefer not to spend too much time dwelling on “awkward” pronunciations for those who are unfamiliar with Mandarin. Despite their sincere efforts, my name still is mispronounced most of the time. Once, upon hearing that I had an English name, a White male I encountered in the study room laughed flippantly and asked, what’s your REAL name? I was deeply shocked. I had never experienced such ignorance, especially as I was usually around my flatmates, most of whom had rich international experience. For my generation (Post-95 or GenZ), it was not rare to have an English name from an early age, either for the purposes of the compulsory school English curriculum or after-school English classes, or simply based on personal preference. It is also a mark of how China has proactively embraced globalisation during the era I grew up in. I was not particularly bothered by what people referred to me as. My different names within different communities became different facets of me, which I embraced as part of my identity. When Caroline Humphrey was carrying out her research in Mongolia in 2009, she stated that names do not merely create a ‘relation’ with the person being named, but a triangulation, which takes place in the interactive space between the person who is named, the people who use the name, and the connotations of the name itself. “What’s your real name?” The logic behind this question, posed to me in the study room, is pretty simple – you “should” have an “authentic” Chinese name if you are an “authentic” Chinese person. This assumption reveals such ignorance and laziness – it is an attempt to fit people of different nationalities and ethnicities into tightly constrained boxes without any willingness to understand the complexities inherent to our identities. Sadly, this logic expands itself into a network of stereotypes and is pervasive across our society. Ethnic Chinese people’s multifaceted identities are often distilled into a vague, one-dimensional mask, sharing the same ideology, personality, and interests. Notwithstanding that defining ‘Chinese’ must interrogate the complicated history of migration and the tricky dynamics of political power, even pointing only to present-day China reveals huge diversity. As in any country, there is a myriad of complexities among communities and groups with diverse ethnic, religious, linguistic affiliations, economic and social backgrounds in China. As China has become an impossible economy to ignore, the prevailing image of Chinese immigrants in the UK has shifted from undocumented labourers in “low-skilled” industries, or survivors seeking political asylum, to “crazy rich” tourists and students splashing out on luxury goods and property. However, there are diverse layers between these two extremes. For some young Chinese immigrants, these stereotypical preconceptions and binaries restrict their potential to become part of various professional sectors in the global community. “Chinese [people] are not creative enough, you guys are good executors”. This was what Lin was constantly told by her White male supervisor when she started her first job as a content creator. Critical thinking and creativity are deemed to be values of Western education, and for Chinese people, these are labelled as skills that need to be acquired by studying abroad. Lin felt uncomfortable but had still internalised the idea, even though she had contributed core content to social media accounts with over 100,000 followers and was adored by many. Lin was one of the interviewees for my MA dissertation, in which I explored the identification¹ and sense of belonging of young professionals from mainland China in London. Encountering such stereotypes and being restricted accordingly was unfortunately commonplace among the interlocutors. Other stories include professional translators specialising in linguistics, who have been limited in their career progression because they are not native English speakers. For these Han Chinese professionals in the UK, China has not disappeared from their lives just because they moved to another country. Many of them are leaning heavily towards ‘Chineseness’ for identification as it becomes their distinctive label under the gaze of the host country². The reason behind this is that identification is an ongoing process. It depends on how we perceive ourselves, how others perceive us, and how we interpret those perceptions. In the workplace, even relatively privileged well-educated young professionals are still perceived as the Other within a set of Western ideals. In turn, being seen as different leads these people to internalise themselves as different. In other words, their awareness of being Chinese in London is a result of being perceived as Chinese first. Lin’s story with her supervisor ends up having a dramatic twist. As he joined another company, Lin took over the team and after a few months, she found herself not only a good executor but also a good creator – a task which Chinese people supposedly could not have done well. The previous supervisor, however, still sent the group work of Lin’s team to a new client and claimed it was his work despite her grievances. Lin, who finally no longer had to put up with the workplace power dynamic of this male superior, voiced all her grievances over a phone call with him. However, Lin’s experience is perhaps fortunate in that there are still many interlocutors who are trapped in cycles of self-doubt, as a result of the labels that have been imposed on them by society. “…trouble is inevitable and the task, how best to make it, what best way to be in it”. The title of this blog is inspired by the renowned feminist scholar Judith Butler’s book “Gender Trouble”. Butler’s idea was to challenge (or trouble) the binary view of sex, gender, and sexuality. Therefore, “Identity trouble” implies a willingness to question and disrupt societal norms and expectations associated with identity categories. As East and South East Asian Heritage Month draws to a close, it might be useful to think about the specific parts (cultures, ethnicities, and languages) that make up this complex conglomerate of East and South East Asia. Who has the authority to define our identities? Are we free to self-identify? What assumptions underlie these identity labels? Do these assumptions help us grow or restrict us? Perhaps, there is a need to dwell upon what labels offer, but also on what they take away. ¹ I use the word identification to suggest that identity is a fluid concept, that it is constantly changing as the self interacts with itself and with the world, and that individuals have the agency to define their identities and explore who they are beyond the limitations imposed by labels. ² The Han Chinese community are a privileged majority in the People’s Republic of China. They hardly reflect on or think about their “Chineseness” in their daily lives. But in the UK they become a minority, and are seen as Chinese, and so they become more aware and conscious of their “Chineseness”. The “Chinese” label does not need to function as a primary identifier in China as it is structurally embedded within people’s identities, although many of them actually have aspirations to escape these nationalistic constraints.

Migrants' Rights Network,“Our heritage is dynamic + constantly changing”,29-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/29/our-heritage-is-dynamic-constantly-changing/,"I am a Hongkonger who has been exiled to the UK. My parents are from mainland China, feel culturally and ethnically Chinese, and are first generation migrants in Hong Kong. We waited decades to be reunited with our family in China. I see how the term “Chinese” has been weaponised, and it makes me not want to associate with it, because the assumption is that I must be pro-Chinese Government. But I am not, and I fled Hong Kong precisely because I was critical of the Chinese Government. How I relate to the term ESEA In Hong Kong, there is no concept of “Asian” or “East and South East Asian”. Most of us are Hongkongers, Han Chinese, South Asian, or non-Asians. From the perspective of foreign expats and elite middle classes in Hong Kong, this city is always seen as a melting pot between ‘East and West’ and a bustling international hub. But to many local residents living in grassroots communities however, there is not much multiculturalism. So, for Hongkongers coming to the UK, the concept of a joint East and South East Asian identity is a new one. It may take months and years to adapt to, since this collective identity was never something that Hongkongers would have even thought about or been conscious of. In Hong Kong, there is not much attention given to anti-racism. The concept of race is a new topic for those raised in Hong Kong. There are many Pakistani and Indian second generation migrants who are born and raised in Hong Kong. Cantonese speakers will often refer to South Asian domestic migrant workers in derogatory terms. Han Chinese communities do not make much effort to reach out to or welcome South Asian communities, and they are also not represented in mainstream media or pop culture. They experience what it is like to be a minority in Hong Kong, and when we come to the UK, we are suddenly no longer the majority: we are minorities too. So, navigating this shift from being part of the majority to being a minority is very interesting and eye opening. It is so important to have ESEA solidarity, but also Asian solidarity, and solidarity with communities beyond Asia. We should be proud to identify under the ESEA label. It is a meaningful label under which we can build solidarity and community. As Hongkongers In Britain , we have encouraged our Outreach Coordinator to do more work on ESEA Heritage Month. We have also worked with the Chinese Community Centre to rename themselves as the ESEA Community Centre. Our organisation was also invited to the PM’s Lunar New Year Celebrations. This used to be commonly referred to as “Chinese New Year”, but the name Lunar New Year is obviously more inclusive, since many who are not Chinese will celebrate this occasion. Lunar New Year is something that unites many of us across the ESEA community. As East and South East Asians, we are also united by our experiences during the height of the Covid pandemic. Many of us have been subjected to racially abusive language, including myself, and have been called “dirty”, simply because we are East or South East Asian. As a Hongkonger in London, the sheer diversity of ethnicities and cultures has impressed me. I see BLM and the Windrush Generation have their own dedicated shelves in London libraries, and I think this is so important. I live in an area in London where there is a large South Asian community. Many Bollywood films are shown in the local cinema, and there are many South Asian restaurants and food shops in my area. This inspires me to get to know and learn about other cultures, histories, and identities. Initiatives such as ESEA Heritage Month can help with this type of cross-cultural understanding. Marginalised voices need to be heard, and as a society we must listen to the stories, struggles and histories of various migrant and migratised groups. Heritage is living culture ‘Heritage’ is the lessons you have taken over decades and centuries, and how you bring them into the present moment. It’s about taking our culture and moving it forward, whether that be medicine, architecture, language, music or political philosophy. Some people think that traditions should tightly control and dictate people’s behaviours, but heritage should be about holding on to elements of the past whilst also being able to change what no longer serves us. Due to the nature of being a colony, Hong Kong culture was once only about practicality, and how to improve one’s economic situation and adjust to new financial situations. But the new generations, especially since 2019, care about protest, social movements, the environment, cultural heritage preservation, humanity, revolution, and the struggle for democracy, autonomy and freedom. This collective struggle for a just society is part of Hong Kong’s heritage. Our heritage is not just trade, modern architecture, financial centres and skyscraper skylines, it is the people and their aspirations. Heritage is dynamic: it doesn’t just involve the past, but also the future. New generations bring new elements to our collective heritage and make it better. Our spirit is still premature, but slowly Hong Kong is developing a spiritual and cultural heritage centred on humanity. There is a stereotype that we are obedient and submissive: but our revolutionary heritage proves this to be a myth. British society needs to listen to our heritage, and take on board the lessons that our heritage can provide. We see ourselves as pioneers, bringing our values and lessons to the UK. This is why the MAP Programme is so important: it allows us an avenue to implement change based on our values and the lessons we have learnt. ESEA Heritage Month: cultural or political? Most people think of heritage as something strictly cultural, about finding common ground beyond the political. And it makes sense in some ways to conceptualise ESEA heritage as something cultural. This is because our struggle for human rights and political issues in Hong Kong may not be shared by other East and South East Asian communities beyond Hong Kong (and Taiwan, since Taiwan also faces CCP aggression). Their political struggles may be different. However, Orientalism and experiences of racial abuse during the pandemic do unite us politically as East and South East Asian migrants in the UK. And sometimes, culture and politics can merge. The Milk Tea Alliance flag: representing Thai milk tea, Hong Kong milk tea and Taiwanese milk tea. Milk Tea Alliance artwork. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, the online human rights movement- the Milk Tea Alliance – was started by Hong Kong, Taiwanese and Thai activists, to protest against authoritarianism. This united the political struggle across Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia through the symbol of milk tea, which has many varieties across East and South East Asia. Hong Kong’s Pillar of Shame (photo via BBC News) Sunflower Seeds, 2010, Ai Wei Wei via TATE Apple Man, 2023, Lumli Lumlong via @lumlilumlong_ The cultural is often political. Art and culture is often used in service of the oppressor, but it can also be a political tool for the oppressed. I have met many exiled Hong Kong painters and sculptors, and I often wonder how their art can be used as a vehicle for political expression. My friends Lumli Lumlong have repeatedly been targeted by the CCP for their political artwork. The Hong Kong Pillar Of Shame commemorates those who died in the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989. In 2023, the sculpture was seized by Hong Kong police. Art is sometimes far more politically powerful than words and speech. Ai Wei Wei has repeatedly been targeted by the CCP for his politically charged work in exposing corruption. Looking to Lunar New Year Lunar New Year is perhaps our most important festival in Hong Kong, and a key part of our heritage. It is a values driven celebration, symbolising unity, family and love. The actions of those in power directly violate the ethos of compassion of this celebration. This celebration, and our heritage as a whole, can guide us towards social justice and can unify us across struggles and continents. Our spiritual, cultural and political heritage is beautiful. We must be proud of our heritage and protect it. East and South East Asian Heritage Month is an amazing opportunity to take control of the narrative and share our stories and heritage on our own terms. Artwork courtesy of Hongkongers in Britain."
Migrants' Rights Network,Open Letter rejecting the Home Secretary’s abhorrent comments,28-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/28/open-letter-rejecting-home-sec-comments/,"We, the undersigned, condemn the comments made by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, on Tuesday that promote hostility towards migrants and migratised communities across Europe through racist and xenophobic rhetoric around “integration”. In her speech the Home Secretary named immigrants an “existential challenge for the political and cultural institutions of the West”. She referred to rapid and extreme cultural change, high rates of immigration, and the “failure” of migrants to “integrate”. This comes amidst her proposals to abandon the 1951 Refugee Convention in favour of stricter measures to limit the eligibility for refugee protection. This is abhorrent- the Refugee Convention should be expanded to explicitly include more grounds: including sexuality and gender, and climate emergencies. This rhetoric is not new; it draws upon decades-old xenophobia that positions non-White migrants as a “threat” and as a security problem to be dealt with. This draws on the Great Replacement Theory – a White supremacist myth, that has resulted in numerous attacks on migrants and other racialised and marginalised communities across Europe in recent years. Blaming “multiculturalism” as the major European “crisis” is misguided and malicious. The real threat to unity is Government scapegoating of migrants, which sows division in our communities. After facing criticism, the Home Secretary has doubled down on this punitive system. She advocates raising the barrier for persecution to the point where people already have to have suffered torture, abuse, and other cruel treatment, rather than experiencing a threat or intense fear of these conditions. This begs the question of how much harm is enough? As more people become displaced due to global crises that Western governments refuse to address or acknowledge, and indeed have caused, it is alarming that many, like the Home Secretary, appear intent on increasing hostility and raising the bar for protection. We cannot allow this kind of divisive and hostile rhetoric to be normalised. We call instead for a humane, compassionate, and welcoming migration system that does not treat people coming to our countries as issues to be solved and numbers to be reduced. We condemn this latest attack on migrants, and we reject the notion that migrants present an existential “threat” to our political and cultural rights and institutions. We stand in unconditional solidarity with migrants and resist the division that the Government is pushing with its words. To sign our open letter, click here ."
Migrants' Rights Network,Everyone has the right to protection,26-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/26/everyone-has-the-right-to-protection/,"The Home Secretary is giving the green light for discrimination against marginalised and oppressed groups, particularly women and queer people,  with the backing of the State. At a time where hate crime is on the rise in the UK and instability is increasing across the globe, this move is highly dangerous. Her assumption that people who face discrimination are wrongly being given refugee status undermines the whole point of refugee protections. With the threshold for qualifying as a refugee already being so high, it is concerning that this Government wants to limit access to refugee protection even further. The reasons people flee are complex and numerous, including discrimination, economic instability and climate change which are all threats to someone’s dignity and quality of life. We are appalled that the Home Secretary has stated refugee protection should not be granted to those who are facing or are fearing discrimination. Refugee conventions exist to provide sanctuary for people fleeing factors including persecution and discrimination. Warnings from history have clearly shown the need for international protections for refugees, particularly in the wake of the Holocaust. The Home Secretary believes that the Refugee Convention is not “fit for the modern age” because the threshold is too low. When in reality, the Refugee Convention is not fit for any age because the threshold is far too high. We will not stop fighting for a world where everyone has the right to protection."

His experiences and insights served as a source of motivation for the attendees, encouraging them to actively strive for positive changes in UK society. Participants expressed a deep appreciation for the communal space provided by the programme, emphasising its important role as a vital bridge connecting newcomers with the broader community. The shared enthusiasm among the fellows for this space reflects their collective eagerness to engage more actively in the UK’s policy-making landscape. Participants said they were excited to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, all united in their pursuit of a better future. The sense of unity among participants underscores the programme’s success in creating a supportive community that goes beyond geographical and cultural boundaries. Looking ahead, the success of the initial workshops sets a promising tone for the upcoming sessions. We’re excited to see how the programme and participants progress!"
Migrants' Rights Network,Migrants’ Aspiration Programme for Hongkongers,20-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/20/migrants-aspiration-programme-hongkongers/,"The Migrants’ Aspiration Programme (MAP) is a Migrants’ Rights Network programme in collaboration with Hongkongers in Britain which aims to support participants’ development as community and political leaders. The programme builds on the success of MRN’s previous Migrants’ Aspiration Programme which ran from Jan 2022 until Feb 2023. The Greater London Authority (GLA) launched the Hong Kong Community Fund in 2023 with the aim of supporting Hongkongers in London and to help them build a sense of belonging in their new communities. MRN was successful in our application for funds and we have launched our free six-month training for any Hong Kong migrant in the UK looking to lead and make a difference. Why Hongkongers? Hong Kong has a unique identity and complex history. As a result of the Opium Wars and subsequent treaties in the mid-19th century, China ceded Hong Kong to the British Empire. The two countries agreed that China would essentially lease Hong Kong to Britain for 99 years. On 1 July 1997, Britain transferred authority of Hong Kong to China and ended 150 years of British rule. Hong Kong became, and remains, a Special Administrative Region (SAR). A key condition of the transfer was something that has become known as the ‘one country, two systems’ policy. This sought to ensure that Hong Kong’s economic, political and judicial systems were kept distinct from mainland China for 50 years. However, over the years, it has become increasingly evident that China is intent on encroaching on the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people. The famous 2014 ‘Umbrella Movement’ saw protests break out across Hong Kong when China announced that only Beijing-approved candidates could run in the 2017 elections in the SAR. In June 2020, the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China unanimously passed a new national security law for Hong Kong that came into immediate effect. This law criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign countries. This legislation is arguably purposely vague to encompass a wide range of activities. Evidence provided to the Home Affairs Select Committee by individuals from Hongkongers in Britain in January 2021 demonstrated the “severe political deterioration” in Hong Kong and widespread safety fears many had. In January 2021, the UK Government created a Hong Kong British Nationals (Overseas) (BN(O)) visa. This allows people from Hong Kong with BN(O) status and their dependent family members to come to the UK to live, work and study on a five year visa. This also gives them a route to permanent settlement and British citizenship. However, there have been numerous challenges for people arriving from Hong Kong. Many have struggled to adjust and thrive in their new communities. Reports of loneliness, mental health issues and difficulty finding work has caused hardship for some Hongkongers with some dying by suicide . Through the Migrants’ Aspiration Programme for Hongkongers, we want to place power and resources into their hands so they can create the positive changes they want to see for themselves and for other people from Hong Kong. Annie Tsang, like many Hongkongers, cherishes the opportunity to move to the UK with her husband and children. While being a volunteer for the first few months for the new London community where she is settling down, she experienced many emotions: she was excited about being registered as a voter, nervous about getting her children into a good school, and as a mid-career professional, she spent a few months finding a job. She joined many events that could maintain her self-identity as Hongkonger, such as arts and films festivals, carnivals, craft and food markets, and even protests and rallies for social justice in Hong Kong. She also attends church and volunteers for community and charitable services with many British locals and those activities made her feel a part of such a vibrant and autonomous community. Looking to the future Annie is just one of many Hongkongers in the UK. Like many others on the BN(O) visa scheme, settling into the UK has presented its challenges and being far from home is incredibly difficult. But she is determined to speak up to the challenges and injustices in our society and work to embolden her fellow Hongkongers to thrive in their new communities. Annie feels the word ‘migrant’ has become a negative word. She wants to reclaim the word ‘migrant’ and show Hongkongers, as well as other migrant communities, that being a migrant can be a powerful force for good. Like other migrants from Hong Kong, Annie wants to see more support and access to mental health services, employment, education and many other areas. MAP for Hongkongers is part of a new stage of empowerment which can help Hongkongers flourish and lead new movements for change."
Migrants' Rights Network,Statement: seven day notice eviction period,19-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/19/seven-day-notice-eviction-period/,"Refugees will now only have seven days notice before being evicted from their asylum support accommodation. This “move-on” notice period falls drastically short of allowing refugees the time they need in order to secure alternative accommodation, and subsequently will subject many to houselessness. It makes no sense for our Government to recognise someone’s asylum claim, commit to helping them, and then allow them only seven days to plan for the rest of their lives. The housing crisis is a product of various Government privatisation policies such as Thatcher’s right to buy scheme, and a capitalist ethos that treats our right to a home as a mere privilege. This crisis impacts all of us and we need radical change in the housing and rental sector in the UK. For migrants, including refugees, navigating this complex and hostile landscape is even more difficult and the Government should not be exacerbating this. Housing is a human right, and we believe everyone deserves access to a safe home, irrespective of their migration status. Homelessness is entirely preventable. The Government must ensure that refugees have time to find secure housing, and access the support they need to move on with their lives."
Migrants' Rights Network,"Abolition, not reform",08-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/08/abolition-not-reform-september-2023-newsletter/,"Dear supporters, Whether it’s the inhumane Migration Act, the crackdown on undocumented workers, or the Government’s appalling asylum accommodation plans, this Government’s cruelty truly knows no bounds. This month, we have reflected on how the Hostile Environment continues to worsen, but also on how mainstream approaches to migrant justice actually legitimise and strengthen the harmful systems we are all fighting against. In this newsletter, we share our Civil Society article and International Day of Charity blog post that argue for abolitionist approaches to migrant justice. This is a conversation we will continue to engage with as we move into an anti-oppression space. This month, we have also been busy calling out the Government’s cruel policies. We coordinated an open letter against its cruel accommodation plans, and also spoke to Al Jazeera about cruel colonial legacies and the need for safe routes. Finally, we share updates from our Words Matter campaign, and our new Hong Kong Migrants’ Aspiration Programme! Thank you for your ongoing support.

Migrants' Rights Network,International Day of Charity,05-Sep-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/09/05/international-day-of-charity/,"International Day of Charity fundamentally exists to celebrate the role charity plays in the world alongside notions of philanthropy. However, at MRN, we believe this day should mark a time for much-needed reflection. As members of civil society, we have to be honest with ourselves about why the charity sector exists, and must reckon with the truth about the space we inhabit. The 5th September was chosen to mark the death of Mother Teresa. This fact tells us a lot about how we are prone to celebrate charity rather than critically engage with its existence. Mother Teresa is perhaps best known for receiving a Nobel Peace prize “for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitute a threat to peace”. The truth is more complex and arguably darker. Mother Teresa is a highly controversial and criticised figure whom, to many, embodies White saviorism. At MRN, we are constantly reflecting about the role of charity, particularly in migration advocacy. In a recent Civil Society article , we asked the question: as migrants’ rights advocates, can we truly be committed to achieving justice while advocating for reforms that keep oppressive systems intact? Transformation not reform In the midst of an increasingly hostile and divisive atmosphere for social justice where the Government is implementing more regressive legislation, the default position can end up being a defence of the status quo. We all work in this sector because we want to reduce suffering and fight for what is right. But often, our desire for immediate change can cause us to become indifferent, and accept concessions at the expense of our end goals. Equity for migrants and racialised people cannot be achieved through our current systems. They are inherently racist and colonial in nature, and so there is no fixing what is purposefully designed to oppress. We must as a sector look towards abolitionist alternatives centred on collective care. This involves ending the criminalisation of migration in all its forms, including ending surveillance, detention, and deportation. We must understand the root causes of the systems we exist within, reject division and build solidarity. Charity industrial complex The charity industrial complex often engages in modern-day colonialism, extraction and domination. It extracts radical revolutionary knowledge and repackages it as neoliberal reformism and single-issue politics. It sanitises violent, colonial histories by taking on the role of a “benevolent” saviour to the Global South. The concessions that charities demand of the Government will only ever cushion and alleviate the effects of oppression ever so slightly, whilst keeping structures and systems of domination (such as capitalism and racism) intact. The existence of the charity industrial complex legitimises the status quo: it normalises the  state’s failure and refusal to provide life’s necessities to its population and those seeking its help. Charities are a symptom of our current world, but also consolidate it. As individuals working in the charity sector, we must expose the oppression upon which the third sector is built, through our campaigning work. We must stop legitimising and normalising harmful policies by centring our entire purpose on minor legislative amendments. We must hope for a world where the work we do is rendered obsolete, and we must make that known. This is the only way we can meaningfully disrupt anything. But disruption is not the abolition and dismantling of harmful systems. Disruption is awareness building: it cultivates our awareness of the fact that systems need to be dismantled and abolished, since harm reduction is not good enough. Harm reduction is not the ceiling to which we should aspire, and we should be loud about this in our campaigning work. Dismantling can only be achieved through a bottom-up struggle. Charities must only have a secondary supportive role to play in all of this, especially those that are White and non lived-experience led. They will never be the driving force behind movements for liberation: people will."

Migrants' Rights Network,"Let’s talk about (Brown) sex, baby",18-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/18/lets-talk-about-brown-sex-sahm/,"As we mark South Asian Heritage Month and as part of our wider work around reclaiming certain narratives and tackling stigma, people in our Network are sharing their stories with us. Anisah Osman Britton, author of Brown Bodies , shares her experience of belonging as part of the East African Indian diaspora in the UK and how she learnt to fight back against colonial-era feelings of shame around sex and relationships that were forced on colonised communities. Colonialist Victorian values were forced on racialised people and these taboos and harmful narratives shape harmful Western perceptions of minoritised groups today. But members of diasporic migrant communities are taking back the narrative. In this piece, she shares her journey of embracing the intricate histories of feminism, sex and power in religion, literature and colonised history. As a Brown person, it often feels like you’re putting your reputation, family name and prospects on the line just by uttering that tiny, singular syllable word, s-e-x. The taboo of all taboos. But here we go! If talking about it outloud makes one other person talk about it outloud, then it’s worth it. Growing up, I always felt the absence of conversations about s-e-x. Our communities — in my case, the East African Indian diaspora — lacked conversation about pleasure, self love, trust, body positivity, confidence, vulnerability, intimacy, fun, about why religions tell you to wait until marriage. There was also no talk about pain, sexual health, fertility difficulties, loss, ongoing consent within relationships, lack or loss of desire or fear. It was always ‘no sex before marriage’ or ‘don’t get pregnant’. I knew I wasn’t going to have sex before marriage. My faith was my guide. When I consciously made that decision, I was about 13 and at school in India. I was surrounded by people with a mixture of outlooks, including religious girls and boys who saw sex as an act that took place within a marriage — I wasn’t an outlier. It made it easy to be confident and comfortable in who I was and in my body. When you’re 13, you’re going through enough changes as it is, that wasn’t another thing I needed. Then, I moved back to the UK, when I was 14 and did my final years of secondary school at an inner city girls school. One thing about inner city schools is they’re filled with kids from every diaspora. It’s the utopia we were promised when they said ‘multicultural society’. In that mix, I found my beliefs understood by the Black Christian girls who attended the pentecostal church near my house at the weekend, the Pakistani Muslim girls who I wasn’t cool enough to hang out with but who would give me the nod of sisterhood when it came to conversations about sex, the White girls who’d grown up in single parent houses and had sworn off sex until after university and everyone else in between who’d been indoctrinated into this mix and had learnt to accept that all of it was ‘normal’. But college? Boy, did things change. It felt like everyday someone was losing their virginity. In their stories, my choices were questioned. ‘Don’t you want to know ?’ ‘Aren’t you worried that they’re not going to be good at it and then you’re stuck with them?’ ‘Don’t you have…needs?’ And the games of assimilation began. Depending on who I spoke to, my story changed. To the cute boy in the library, I said I was waiting for the right guy. To the girls on my course, I was experimenting. To the Islamic society, I was waiting until marriage. I felt lost. My body no longer felt like my own. And I became obsessed with sex. Not with the act of it, but how it affected and impacted everything . In English literature, I looked for the author’s motivation and more often than not, sex. In the canteen, I watched how boys changed how they spoke when they were talking to someone attractive — sex. I observed the Christian and Muslim girls talk about marriage more than any other of my friends — sex. I watched myself change as my faith clashed with the Western world’s expectation of how I used my body. I observed myself become more anxious about articulating my faith and my beliefs around sex. And mostly? I discovered my own obsession with sex. I learnt about women’s rights to pleasure and sexual fulfilment in Islam. I read about the erotic history of India. I horrifyingly discovered the role of colonialism in creating and forcing people to feel shame. I explored the world of erotic literature from South America. I found myself in history. I found my voice in the voice of authors. I found my faith confirmed by stories of love. I found my anger in the lack of inclusion for different normalities. The intertwinement of faith and culture with pleasure can be beautiful. Our histories are rich with it. But it can be messy, there are tons of nonsense articles and bad faith players online and so much ‘fake news’ is passed down under the pretence of ‘religion’ or culture. And we need to talk about it. We need to talk about the fact women have painful sex their entire lives because they’ve been told it’s normal. We need to talk about men feeling like they need to know it all when it comes to sex and the barriers it’s putting up to their pleasure. As Kapil Gupta said when I interviewed him for Brown Bodies . We need to talk about the repression in our communities that keeps our desire locked up. If you suppress your feelings for long enough, it leads to numbness — a feeling of emptiness and an absence of emotion. We need to talk about why we see sex as dirty, secret and quiet. We need to talk about why our communities struggle to seek legitimate help when it comes to sex and sexual health. We need to talk about how many people are hiding: their sexuality, their internal gender battles and their partners from a different faith. We need to talk about the challenges individuals face while they try to uphold religious and cultural beliefs whilst navigating the Western world’s expectations of how you use your body. “When I moved to London, a friend warned me how different relationships are here: people have sex first, then they decide if they want a relationship. Whereas in Asia, people date first,” says Eshita Kabra-Davies in her Brown Bodies chat. And that’s just a few of the things we need to talk about. Sex impacts us all, whether we’re having it or not — not only does it affect our love lives, it plays an important role in our confidence and the way we carry ourselves in the world, our careers, our interactions with our communities, our relationships with ourselves, our parents, family, God, faith, spirituality."
Migrants' Rights Network,Rebelling against the colonisers,17-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/17/rebelling-against-the-colonisers-sahm/,"The dastarkhan Years ago when we travelled to Pakistan, and we sat around the dastarkhan (the cloth for eating food on the floor) eating mangoes with the rest of the family, we vividly remember our grandfather, or as we called him ‘Nana’, making a passing comment about being put in solitary confinement by the British Army. At the time in our younger years, we didn’t pay it much mind because who would listen and think that wasn’t normal. Now, as Pakistani diaspora women, we wish we’d listened harder because these defining moments have left his mark on us. Nana’s defiance My grandfather passed quite suddenly over 20 years ago, at the age of 75. His death devastated us as a family because we just always thought he would be there, forever just sitting praying for us, reading fortunes and pouring into us his love and defiance. In the preceding years since his passing, whenever we would gather as a family and Nana was mentioned, we would talk about his life and the stories we know of – and the story of his defiance and incarceration by the British is one that always comes up. We’d heard the headline from Nana that at the age of 19 he went off in a stubborn and defiant rage against his family’s wishes, and joined the British army. How we remember Nana We remember our Nana as a tall, strong pathan with a white beard who spent most of his time in prayers, telling us off for staying up too late and stating that we were ‘letting the devil in’, or spending time making things like a troll’s house (when there was that whole obsession). Though in his youth, Nana was the type of fiery individual who never backed down from his point of view, he was the type of man that would go off hunting on his own in the mountains for days, or if he had pain in his tooth, ask the local “dentist/cobbler” to yank his tooth out just because he couldn’t be bothered to deal with the pain. If ever there was someone who lived their life on their own terms – he embodied it. His enigmatic presence and personality was deeply ingrained in us and his fortitude has passed through to his descendants. Our grandfather always challenged the gender norms for his era: we saw him cooking, cleaning, mending his own clothes – he was so confident in who he was that he didn’t care what others thought of him, as long as he could serve and be true in front of his Lord. Even when he’d been wronged – quite horrendously by people who were family – he never held a grudge against them, and he still met them with love and acceptance. Insolence As discussions around migration and colonialism are brought up, our mother and uncle retell the story of Nana’s jail time when Britain still ruled over what is now Pakistan. So the story goes: as a young man, and way before he was married and had six children, and most likely in his main ‘rebel without a cause’ era, he was being berated for being a ‘nobody’ and ‘good for nothing’ unlike his older brother who was a successful contractor. So off he went to show everyone who he really was and joined the British Army. As soon as he joined he was told that he was going to serve the British Army in Myanmar (then known as Burma). He refused, saying ‘how could he justify killing his own people for foreigners?’ We can imagine the look of abject horror on the face of his superior at Nana’s sheer wilful defiance as his steely, brown eyes stared them down – especially being a fair-skinned Pakistani man who was staring back at another white man – how very dare he? But my grandfather didn’t care. His service and fear was only in God – no British army, no colonel, no one could scare him to do anything that was against his moral code. So for that insolence he was carted off to solitary confinement, only being given one meal of bread and water a day. Every day, the officers came and asked if had changed his mind and would fight. Every day, he said ‘no, not today’. A part of me hopes he added ‘not today satan’. This continued for 3 months. He was immovable and nothing would change his mind. Dishonour as a badge of honour What the British army hadn’t contended with was that Nana’s older brother was a successful contractor and had built many roads, bridges and such like through army contracts. It was through these contacts that he was given reprieve from his confinement, and he was ‘dishonourably discharged’ from the army. A proud moment in our family’s history in defying his occupiers; that “dishonour” is a badge of honour and pride to us. After that stint, Nana would mock people who went off to ‘serve the King’. Our Nana’s rebellious streak has passed through to all of us – in particular the Pakistani diaspora women in the family – we have all gone against the grain. We are vocal about political and social injustices, and in challenging the existing patriarchal hegemony, which is funnily all thanks to our Nana’s resilience. by Fizza + Sadaf Qureshi"

Migrants' Rights Network,The Hostile Environment just got worse.,08-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/08/the-hostile-environment-just-got-worse/,"As part of the Government’s latest assault on migrants’ rights, they have announced a massive increase in fines and penalties to businesses found to be employing an undocumented migrant worker. Initial fines have been increased to £45,000 per worker from £20,000. These will come into effect at the start of 2024. These fines are a huge income stream for the Home Office. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, 346 civil penalties were issued to the value of £6 million. The immigration taskforce, which was announced at the beginning of the year, will launch a consultation into stronger measures aimed at deterring businesses from employing workers without permission to work¹. In response, the Shadow Immigration Minister has condemned the policy on the basis it is not tough enough, stating “strengthening penalties must be combined with stronger enforcement action if the Government is serious about tackling the problems.” From initial research at MRN, we have found that business owners from racialised and minoritised backgrounds are being targeted for immigration raids, and that in many cases, these immigration raids are conducted without appropriate warrants and within the scope of the law. It is disappointing to see the Government pushing forward with these plans whilst the Opposition calls for even tougher measures. At MRN, we know from our work on the exploitation of migrant workers and immigration enforcement in the workplace that raids are causing widespread problems and destroying communities. We stand opposed to immigration raids and the increasing demonisation of undocumented workers. Borders should not exist in everyday life, including the workplace.

Migrants' Rights Network,Stand With Trans,02-Aug-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/08/02/stand-with-trans/,"At MRN, we are working hard to challenge hate and systems of oppression in all forms, including transphobia. We are incredibly concerned about the rise in transphobic hate and the rollback of LGBTQ+ inclusion in society. This is impacting trans and non-binary people’s experience in the workplace, access to healthcare and housing. We also know that this form of oppression intersects with race, nationality and immigration status to impact trans migrants’ sense of belonging. Solidarity is unconditional. We must stand with our trans, non-binary and gender diverse communities in their fights for rights and justice. We cannot dismantle racism without dismantling transphobia, since definitions of gender are intimately bound with White supremacy. We cannot dismantle one form of oppression without dismantling all other forms of oppression: they are interlinked and sustained by the same overarching system of power. As a UK-wide charity, we have a responsibility to stand with the trans+ community and make sure the charity sector is a safe place for all trans and non-binary people. Join us and say no to anti-trans hate."
Migrants' Rights Network,Statement: citizenship deprivation + the “good character” requirement,31-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/31/deprivation-of-citizenship-good-character/,"Today, the Home Secretary announced new rules will come into force around deprivation of citizenship based on the “good character” requirement. We are shocked at the proposed changes to deny citizenship to anyone that has a criminal sentence of 12 months, which means that many more will be denied their social and political rights. We are also very troubled by the Home Secretary’s remark which suggested that access to free healthcare will be linked to citizenship, and we urge the Home Office to provide more details on this aspect. Despite her claims, citizenship is not a privilege, it is a fundamental right because your access to social and many political rights are linked to citizenship. MRN has seen firsthand the impact “good character” requirements have on migrants. Through our campaigning alongside the Highly Skilled Migrants , we witnessed how being denied indefinite leave to remain and being accused of “not being conducive to public good” due to “tax discrepancies”, left many destitute, without access to public funds or permission to work, and with substantial debt.

Migrants' Rights Network,Inhumane Migration Bill: Open Letter,21-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/21/inhumane-migration-bill-open-letter/,"Yesterday, the inhumane Migration Bill became law. This cruel legislation will have a devastating impact on migrants and refugees. That’s why we’ve joined our friends at Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Women for Refugee Women, Just Right Scotland, Scottish Refugee Council, After Exploitation, City of Sanctuary, Refugee & Migrant Forum of Essex & London and Anti-Slavery International to say “Not in our name”. No one is illegal. We will continue to fight for the rights of everyone and ask you to show your solidarity by signing our open letter to the Prime Minister. Open Letter Dear Prime Minister, We write united in our grief, outrage, and shame at the new migration law being passed, allegedly in our name. Your new law is a cruel and inhumane attack on people who are seeking safety on our shores, and who will now be turned away in their hour of need. We all deserve to live safely, and to be supported and protected, whether we are forced to move because our home is no longer safe, or simply for a better life. This compassion is at the heart of our moral duty as a society, as well as our commitment to international law. People move – we always have, and we always will. Community and solidarity are values that bind us all together. We stand in solidarity with everyone targeted by this cruel and immoral legislation. We condemn this Government’s ongoing attacks on migrants and refuse to be complicit in the human rights violations that will result from it. We urge you to abandon this cruel project, and instead protect the rights of people seeking safety. We reject this Act, and say loudly and clearly: this hateful new law is not in our name . You can sign the open letter here ."
Migrants' Rights Network,Trade Unions + Migrant Organisations’ Statement,20-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/20/trade-union-migrant-org-statement/,"As trade unions and migrant organisations, we stand against this Government’s attempts to pit worker against worker. We know that an injury to one is an injury to all. All workers deserve decent pay, safe working conditions and protections if our bosses seek to take advantage of us. Public sector workers deserve pay rises, but we strongly oppose any decision to fund this by further taxing migrants, by hiking visa costs and NHS fees. This is a blatant attempt to sow division within the labour movement and our communities. Increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge by 66% and increasing visa costs will push ever more people into destitution and poverty. The UK already effectively taxes migrants twice for healthcare, and has some of the most extortionate visa fees in Europe – a migrant family of four often has to pay around £50,000 over 10 years for the right to stay. This massive increase is simply unaffordable – it will price workers out of being able to afford a visa and force thousands further into poverty during the cost of living crisis, or out of the country. Migrant workers are a  vital part of our communities and our workforce. They are the backbone of our public services, and our migrant members already face the hostility of the immigration system. No worker should be pushed into poverty, unsustainable debt or homelessness simply because of the papers they hold. We urge the Government to abandon its plans to increase NHS and visa fees for migrants and meet the pay demands of our public sector workers through progressive taxation which ensures those with the broadest shoulders contribute more to our vital public services.

Migrants' Rights Network,South Asian Heritage Month,18-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/18/south-asian-heritage-month/,"This South Asian Heritage Month, we are celebrating the resilience and beauty of South Asian cultures and identities. But it is also necessary to spotlight the experiences of the most marginalised South Asian communities: such as darker-skinned South Asians, Black South Asians, Tamils, Muslims, queer South Asians, and South Asians from lower castes. South Asian diasporas in the UK have often faced racism and Islamophobia in the form of surveillance and police brutality. As anti-migrant sentiment increases in the UK, South Asians will continue to be excluded and demonised. South Asia is commonly referred to as the countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. However, we also acknowledge that there are South Asian communities with a connection to the African continent, as many South Asians are also Mauritian, Ugandan and Kenyan. As the month progresses, we will be sharing stories and reflections on the importance of South Asian Heritage Month. It is also important to bear in mind the long legacy of British colonialism in the South Asian region, and how that has defined migration to the UK and shaped experiences of diasporic belonging.

Migrants' Rights Network,The gender binary is white supremacy,14-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/14/the-gender-binary-is-white-supremacy/,"Being non-binary is about embracing my fluidity, my becoming, my journey without fixed destination . Alok V Menon We have previously spoken about how migrants, trans+ and non-binary people are all being scapegoated by the Government and society in order to distract from policy failures and austerity. An environment of hatred and hostility towards trans+ and non binary people, coupled with anti-migrant hatred, is detrimentally impacting people from the Global South who are seeking asylum in, or are moving to, the UK. For Non-Binary Awareness Week and International Non-Binary People’s Day, we wanted to write a blog on how White supremacy is foundational to the enforcement of the gender binary. But before we do this, it is important to familiarise ourselves with some definitions: Sex: a person’s sex characteristics, including their genitalia, but also chromosomes, hormones and secondary sex characteristics such as breasts and facial hair. Assigned sex at birth: when you are born, the doctor takes a look at your genitalia and decides your sex based on this fact. Intersex : a person whose sex characteristics are ambiguous or do not fit neatly into the characteristics defining male sex or female sex. Gender : someone’s conception of self. Gender binary : the idea that there are only two genders: man and woman. Cisgender person : a person whose gender identity corresponds to their assigned sex at birth. Transgender person : a person whose gender identity does not correspond to or align with their sex assigned at birth. Biological essentialism : the idea that gender is only based on someone’s assigned sex at birth. Non-binary person: a person whose gender identity does not correspond to or fit neatly with manhood or womanhood. This can include people whose gender is neither man or woman, whose gender is both man and woman, or whose gender is expansive and exists beyond the categories of man and/or woman. For more definitions, click here and here . For more information on biological sex and biological essentialism as pertains to gender, click here and here . The sex binary Before we talk about the construction of the gender binary, it is useful to speak about the construction of the sex binary. The idea that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that everyone fits neatly into either the female sex or the male sex, is demonstrably false. Intersex people exist and have always existed. Someone can have XX chromosomes and typically male genitalia, or XY chromosomes and typically female genitalia, or even XXY chromosomes, or ambiguous genitalia, or either levels of testosterone or estrogen that do not correspond to the expected amount that someone possessing their genitalia would typically have. Some people with XY chromosomes have less facial or body hair, or less testosterone, and some people with XX chromosomes may have more facial or body hair, or smaller breasts. Basically, sex is scientifically a lot more complicated than we are taught to believe, because a lot of us will fall somewhere on the spectrum, never neatly female or male, even if we do not identify as intersex ourselves. And this is because the sex binary is a White man’s creation: it was always meant to exclude communities (even White communities) that do not fit neatly into its boxes. That is why even today, BIPOC women continue to be penalised for failure to fit into categories that have no real innate importance. For example, Caster Semenya was penalised for her body’s high levels of testosterone production , yet this has no bearing on her gender identity. The history of the sex binary The construction of sex as a concept has always been rooted in White supremacy. Before the Enlightenment, sex was viewed as dualistic: “males and females were viewed as different forms of the same sex…the vagina was understood as an interior penis, the womb as a scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles” . After the Enlightenment, White males and females began to be viewed as two dichotomous and distinct sexes, with differing brains, skeletons and nervous systems, and it was these differences that justified and explained the different gender roles and social entitlements of man and woman. This White conceptualisation of sex then came to justify racism. It was argued that the greater the differentiation between males and females within a race, the higher up in the racial hierarchy that race would be. Western scientists of the time argued that in White people, the male and female sex were highly differentiated, but that in other races, males and females were not as differentiated, and therefore these races were deemed to be inferior, uncivilised and lagging behind. Sexual differentiation was seen to be a marker of civilisation that could only be accessed by White people, who they believed had “evolved” beyond primitivism. For instance, White colonisers deemed the genitalia of Black women to be animalistic and hypermasculine, and therefore indicative of savagery. The gender binary So how does the construction of sex determine the construction of gender? The gender binary, the idea that there are only two genders, man and woman, does rest considerably on the idea of the sex binary. This is because Western scientists believed that it was binary gender roles that helped White people to develop sex differentiation between males and females, and that the reason that non-White people had not developed sex differentiation, was because they did not have binary gender roles. Western scientists believed that if they imposed their idea of gender onto non-European people, they too would be able to “evolve” into a sex-differentiated race. But also, it is worthwhile remembering that Western ideas of gender also then go on to inform and maintain certain sex-based categorisations: in other words, “cultural ideas of what a man or a woman should be, dictate how we define and divide biological sex” . This means that our understanding of sex determines our understanding of gender, and vice versa. Fundamental to the White gender binary was the distinction between the private and public sphere , as informed by pseudoscience or race science. Because of their alleged different brain size, White women were deemed to be too emotional and not rational enough, and therefore their duty was to be homemakers and reproductive vessels. White men were deemed to be rational, and suited to the public sphere. Western scientists also believed that if the distinction between the public and private spheres was blurred (for instance via masculinised White women being able to vote or participate in sports), men would become feminised, and this would lead to an evolutionary regression back to primitivism (a lack of sex differentiation). And it was also believed that White men would reach their evolutionary potential through machismo and militarism, which in turn justified imperial conquest. Gender colonialism The White gender binary has been imposed onto non-Western people via continuing processes of either direct or indirect colonisation . While many pre-colonial societies surely did not approve of gender variance, in many pre-colonial societies however, gender was not binary, and there are numerous documented examples of gender variance and gender nonconformity. In many pre-colonial societies, individuals who lived outside of the binary as a “third sex” or “third gender” were often considered sacred and revered by the community, such as the Hijras of India, the Mahu of Hawaii and Tahiti, or the Two Spirit people of the “Americas”. Hijras and Two Spirit people now face demonisation. Gender for the Dagaaba tribe of Ghana, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast was assigned based on “energy”, not anatomy . Some communities also continue to recognise the existence of five genders , such as the Bugis people of Indonesia. White colonisers attributed gender non conformity and gender variance to non-European people, even to those who fit within non-European gender norms, since the appearance and social roles of non-European people did not fit within the Western gender binary. In Qajar Iran for instance, men were often beardless, while the moustache was considered to be a sign of women’s beauty . White colonisers demonised this non conformity as “savage” and “ degenerate ”, in order to justify colonialism and deny non-European people of self-governance. They then went on to criminalise this non-conformity and subject colonised people to forced assimilation into Western gender systems. Meanwhile, within Europe, queerness was demonised and blamed for “decline”: it was seen as a symptom of primitiveness that still “lingered in the white race” , and that could be eradicated via eugenics and the enforcement of the gender binary, in order to achieve the highest stage of human evolutionary development. As Alok V Menon writes, “racism is foundational to gender norms and gender norms are essential to racism. Gender is a racial construct; race is a gendered construct” . Gender liberation How do we liberate ourselves from the racist prison of gender? We have to be wary of biological determinism. Biological determinism is the idea that LGBTQ+ people are the way they are because of an innate genetic or physiological biology. Arguments for LGBTQ+ acceptance that centre on LGBTQ+ people being “born this way” or having a “trans or gay brain” actually validate the nature versus nurture binary, which has eugenic roots. But this binary is reductive, since “it’s impossible to isolate the body outside of environmental factors ”. Our anatomy, brains and identities are continuously formed in relation to environmental and social factors. This is normal. This nature versus nurture binary has also been used historically to subject queer people to horrific invasive procedures and operations in an attempt to “cure” them. As Michael Paramo writes, “binary gender rests on a faulty assumption that human souls must be limited in expressing themselves in certain manners solely based upon the fleshy structures they happen to inhabit ”. Biology is not destiny. Genitalia is not prophecy. We are far more expansive than a body . Alok V Menon Conclusion The ways we define sex and gender today are not natural or universal, but rather are intimately bound up with white supremacy. Our understandings of both sex and gender are informed by White knowledge systems that can be traced back to the colonial period. These knowledge systems demonised and attempted to erase gender variance or anything that did not fit neatly into Western understandings of sex and gender. Some Black, Indigenous and POC non binary individuals assert their gender as a rejection of these colonial legacies, but also as a defiance or interrogation of the categories of womanhood and manhood that were never designed to include them in the first place . The stories of BIPOC non binary and gender expansive people are the stories that we must be centering, since gender cannot be understood without race. We must decolonise gender if we are to defy white supremacy. The reason you do not fight for me is because you are not fighting for yourself fully…I have an unshakeable and irrevocable sense of who I am, because I am divine. I come from people who were exterminated and targetted by colonists, because the gender binary was superimposed on Black people, Indigenous people, and People of Colour by European colonists. And the reason that they targetted us is because they knew our power. So the reason that there’s so much animus against me is because of my power… I don’t think the majority of people are ready to heal, and that’s why they repress us, as trans and gender variant people, because they’ve done this violence to themselves first…They’ve repressed their own gender non-conformity. They’ve repressed their own ambivalence. They’ve repressed their own creativity. And so when they see us have the audacity to live a life without compromise… and create our own beauty, instead of saying “thank you for teaching me another way to live”, they try to disappear us, because they did that to themselves first.

Migrants' Rights Network,Disability Pride Month,06-Jul-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/07/06/disability-pride-month/,"Disability Pride month is a rejection of internalised shame, and an invitation to wider society to rethink the ways they define and conceptualise disabilities. It also draws attention to the very real ableism that continues to impose legal, societal and psychological barriers on Disabled communities. Disability justice involves an intersectional approach. Certain groups, such as migratised and racialised communities, are disproportionately affected by disability and by specific stigmas surrounding disability or obstacles to getting support. Sanctuary seekers are often debilitated and disabled by war and conflict, whether psychologically or physically or otherwise. Queer people, in particular QTIPOC (Queer Trans Intersex People of Colour), are disproportionately affected by mental health problems. We must think about the ways that class status intersects with, and hinders, access to adequate support and therapy. We must also consider the ways that capitalism has contributed to the prevalence of depression and anxiety, burnout and other disabilities. As someone who lives with a variety of mental health disorders, such as OCD, anxiety, body dysmorphia and dermatillomania, I haven’t always been aware of Disability Pride Month. But I think it is a necessary and beautiful thing. I have personally experienced ableist gaslighting, where I am made to feel like I am the problem, as opposed to the world around me being the problem. I have been made to feel like a burden, like I am “too much”, simply for existing, or simply for asking that I be treated with compassion. I have been made to feel ridiculous for demanding more than the bare minimum. And I have been left full of rage and disgust after seeing those who mistreated me suddenly claim to care about Disabled people. My personal experience of ableist gaslighting also informs my anti-capitalist views. Capitalism labels disabled people as economically unproductive, and so they are treated as “disposable” and unworthy of respect because of this. In our world, money always takes precedence over people’s lives, well-being and safety. And this money-obsessed mentality dictates society’s appalling treatment of Disabled people. Being a migrant from a West Asian background, I have also experienced the specific ableism that is fuelled by the “model minority” myth: the fact that we just have to keep going. That is what the older generations of my community had no choice but to do. Because of this, I have been misunderstood, and have been made to feel “lazy”, like “a failure”, or like I am overreacting. The fact that I have a disability doesn’t mean that I understand what it is like to live with a different kind of disability, and I have been ignorant towards or misunderstood other kinds of disability in the past. Even when I was younger, I had internalised ableism to the point that I was ashamed to have mental health issues, and I wanted to keep it a secret. It is so easy to internalise ableism, and then project it on to other disabled people, since we have all been brought up surrounded by it. But we can all do better, myself included! As with all social justice movements, it is a lifelong journey of commitment. Disability justice doesn’t require perfection: it requires humility, accountability, and a willingness and openness to learn from one’s mistakes. The medical model frames disability as an “issue” existing within the individual that needs to be “fixed”. Truly understanding disability involves moving away from the the very narrow medical model of disability, towards the social and holistic models of disability. For instance, some disabilities (such as mobility or sensory disabilities) can be better understood through the social model of disability. The social model of disability understands that it is society that disables people, and that the world needs to be fixed. However, many disabilities (such as dermatillomania) are better understood through the holistic model, which integrates elements of the medical and social models. Ultimately, we need to shift our understanding of disability and shift the way the world treats Disabled people and disabilities. A world where Disabled people can thrive is a world where people are respected as they are. by Anastasia Gavalas References + Resources: For more information about Disability Pride Month and the Disability Pride Flag, click here and here .

Migrants' Rights Network,How capitalism harms migrants + queer people,29-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/29/capitalism-harms-migrants-and-queer-people/,"In a previous blog post, we spoke about how the State enacts oppression against queer people and other marginalised groups. In this blog post, we will talk about how capitalism and the market subject queer people and other marginalised groups to harm. “Homocapitalism” Rahul Rao uses the term homocapitalism to describe how the market accepts “palatable” and “respectable” LGBTQ+ people, for the purposes of profit, since they are the ones with the most financial capital. The financial empowerment of White LGBTQ+ people is dependent on, and obscures, the deliberate marginalisation and suffering of racialised and migratised queer people. One example of this is the long-standing gentrification of queer spaces. “Homonecronationalism” + gentrification Elijah Edelman came up with the theory of homonecronationalism in order to explain the gentrification taking place in European cities, and how this rests on the capitalist targeting and expulsion of racialised and diasporic queer communities. Homonecronationalism explains how racialised, migratised and working-class queer people are constructed as “bad queers”, economically unproductive, or as “threats”, in order to justify their removal from neighbourhoods that are in the process of being gentrified. Queer working class diasporic community spaces that are deemed unprofitable within a capitalist system are destroyed via marginalisation, criminalisation, discrimination, destruction of public housing, police surveillance or killings, often by State institutions and corporate bodies. This then creates the space for the “good”, economically productive LGBTQ+ communities and corporates to appear, which is then used deliberately to distract from the gentrification that has taken place. In the UK context, racialised and migratised queer people are expelled from inner city areas in order to make space for gentrification. They are excluded from basic services, and their community spaces are shut down and demolished, which pushes them out of the areas in which they live and into high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. Through gentrification, areas such as Hackney, Soho and Brixton, with vibrant histories of Black radical queer communities, increasingly become sites of commercialised White gay nightlife. Aside from gentrification, the corporate appropriation of Pride also enacts harm against queer and migrant communities. Corporate appropriation of Pride Pride and the struggle for queer justice are often emptied of their radical history, and distilled into a neoliberal marketing tactic. Corporate appropriation of the queer struggle is commonly referred to as “rainbow capitalism”. Rainbow capitalism erases the anti-capitalist and anti-corporate roots and history of the queer liberation movement. It also obscures the continued harm that these corporations enact : companies release Pride and LGBTQ+ merchandise to present a queer friendly facade, and to distract from their continued exploitation of migrant workers in their supply chains. This is pinkwashing. Rainbow capitalism and pinkwashing means that consumers are buying LGBTQ+ merchandise in an attempt to be seen as allies without doing anything to tackle inequalities facing queer communities. Rainbow capitalism perpetuates the belief that individual acts of consumerism count as activism. This steers people away from engaging in actual collective radical activism that challenges the exploitation of migrant workers and other oppressive systems. Aside from depoliticising the struggle for queer liberation and presenting it as a single-issue corporate endeavour, rainbow capitalism also silences and decenters actual intersectional queer organising. Corporate support of the LGBTQ+ struggle is always performative, opportunistic and profit-driven. This shows us that inclusion is not synonymous with liberation. Inclusion into capitalism is always based on respectability, which acts to further harm marginalised queer people such as queer migrants and queer POC. We can use our understanding of rainbow capitalism to work for an intersectional politics that challenges mainstream respectability and consumerism, and that fights for the liberation of both queer people and migrants, especially those deemed economically unproductive. by Anastasia Gavalas For more information on how pinkwashing is used by states, visit the Al Qaws website here .

Migrants' Rights Network,State oppression of queer people,28-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/28/state-oppression-of-queer-people/,"The State attempts to sanitise its enduring colonial violence through its appropriation of Pride. In this blog, we will discuss the multiple ways that the UK Government enacts oppression against queer people. “Homonationalism” revisited: division At MRN, we have spoken before about homonationalism . Homonationalism is a concept proposed by Jasbir Puar which refers to the ways that “palatable” and “respectable” LGBTQ+ people and movements are accepted into the nation, in order to legitimise racist political agendas. The function of homonationalism is to ensure migratised and racialised communities end up being pitted against queer communities, which serves as a distraction from the real systems and forces that oppress queer people around the world. Homonationalism is the weaponisation of LGBTQ+ rights for the purpose of stoking hostility against migratised and racialised communities. Migratised and racialised groups are demonised and labelled as “homophobic”, in order to justify subjecting them to border violence, surveillance and hostile foreign policies. Homonationalism is not the “be all and end all” of the State’s cruelty: it is also connected to other forms of violence against queer communities. “Necropolitics”: death + distraction The concept of necropolitics was proposed by Achille Mbembe . It explains how the State is primarily and deliberately concerned with bringing about both gradual or instant death for certain populations that it deems to be “disposable”, such as racialised, migratised and homeless people. It brings about instant death through police and extrajudicial killings, whilst it brings about gradual death through withholding of basic necessities. It distracts from both of these things through displays of wealth and prosperity. We can see necropolitics in action through looking at the prosperity of European nations. The wealth of modern Europe disguises, but is also fundamentally dependent on, the centuries of colonial racial violence against, and dispossession of, the Black and Brown “Other”. “Queer necropolitics”: queer death + distraction The State’s protection and celebration of privileged LGBTQ+ people both depends on and obscures the active erasure, oppression and debilitation of racialised, migratised and working class queer people. This is what Jin Haritaworn, Adi Kuntsman, and Silvia Posocco call queer necropolitics . Those LGBTQ+ people privileged enough to be afforded some protection by the State are themselves complicit in militarism and imperialism: mainstream state-sanctioned LGBTQ+ movements are made up of the most privileged in the community, and will often perpetuate homonationalistic rhetoric. Essentially, the idea that the West must protect itself from the “homophobic” East, and that it must “save” queer people living in the Global South. Queer necropolitics can explain the ways that the British military and Metropolitan Police , both arms of the State, present themselves as “diverse” queer-friendly entities whose servicemen have attended London Pride. At the same time, they target racialised and migratised queer people at home, at the border, and abroad. The Home Office also attempts to present a “gay-friendly” facade and to pinkwash its cruelty , whilst continuing to enact detention, deportation and brutality against migratised and racialised communities. The “politics of rightful killing”: neglect While queer necropolitics exposes how racialised and migratised queer people are deemed as unworthy of protection and therefore subjected to oppression, the “ politics of rightful killing ” shows a different kind of oppression being enacted against queer people. Once the State has used queer people for its political agenda, it stops protecting them, and then neglects them to the point of death. This is what Sima Shakhsari calls the “politics of rightful killing”. We know that Europe weaponises the deaths of queer people in the Global South by framing such deaths as the result of “queerphobic” “barbaric” cultures. In doing so, Europe frames itself as the opposite: as a queer-friendly haven of freedom and rights, and uses this contrast to justify White saviourism, homonationalist civilising missions and imperial wars, which all lead to displacement. The politics of rightful killing shows us how queer asylum seekers and refugees from the Global South are conditionally deemed worthy of protection (in order to justify Western intervention in their home country), but once these sanctuary seekers reach Europe, they have served their purpose, and so the protection afforded to them is revoked, and they are neglected to the point of death. by Anastasia Gavalas References: https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/postgraduate/masters/modules/theoryfromthemargins/mbembe_22necropolitics22.pdf https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8d8e9acb38a_jin-haritaworn-queer-necropolitics-21.pdf https://static1.squarespace.com/static/550a1c94e4b0545b6579edde/t/5ad37225aa4a99046700bd88/1523806764097/Terrorist_Assemblages_Homonationalism_in_Queer_Times_Jasbir_Puar_2007.pdf?fbclid=IwAR15-Q32cPwsUqe-1gTAb6V6AViKVa6nuvOL4VH4qfBKYsKj-iNtw1Hgq48 https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/53165/1/the-gross-grim-irony-of-the-uk-home-offices-pride-rebrand https://www.gov.uk/government/news/armed-forces-on-parade-at-pride-in-london https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/07/01/pride-in-london-uniformed-met-police"
Migrants' Rights Network,Biphobia in the UK asylum system,27-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/27/biphobia-asylum-system/,"At MRN, we want to unpack bisexuality, biphobia and the experience of queer people in the asylum system. We draw on the experiences of our team and wider Network to consider how stereotypes and biphobia are impacting people currently in the UK asylum system. Bi/M-spec¹ visibility Bisexuality is both a label and an umbrella that is distinct from lesbian and gay people. It is the term used to describe people who experience a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards more than one gender. We may describe ourselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms including bisexual, pansexual, abrosexual/fluid and queer². As bi people, we often experience a unique form of discrimination and erasure from straight people and other members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, this is often not recognised. Biphobia can manifest itself in the widespread stereotypes that bi people are “greedy” or “confused”. This can lead to exclusion from the community, community that can be incredibly vital to newly arrived queer people in the UK. Bi people, especially those in relationships with people of different genders, can be assumed to be heterosexual. Furthermore, there is an assumption that bi people possess a degree of privilege because they “can pretend to be straight”. For some bi people, this can result in imposter syndrome or feel like their experiences as queer people are not as valid as others. For bisexual asylum seekers seeking safety on the grounds of sexuality, this misconception can have damaging consequences for their asylum claims. One member of our Network told us that Home Office staff demonstrated a clear lack of understanding of bisexuality by consistently labelling them as “gay” despite them stating they were bisexual. The burden often falls on bi/m-spec asylum seekers to have to explain the nuances of their sexuality to an institution that is profoundly anti-queer. It has been widely documented that the Home Office has an ingrained ‘disbelief culture’ towards LGBTQ+ asylum seekers³. Many feel the burden of proof and are often subjected to traumatising interviews in order to demonstrate they queer. Through our Network at MRN, we have heard shocking stories of the lengths people are going to in order to meet the Home Office’s high threshold of proof including one person who provided a sex tape as part of his evidence. Queer people are already made vulnerable by our society, yet the Home Office subjects queer asylum seekers to further horrifying treatment and acts to reinforce their trauma. The Home Office does not foster a safe or inclusive environment for asylum seekers, especially for those who are bi or m-spec. It must be abolished. Misrecognition + erasure: a personal account “During my asylum claim process, I experienced the consequences of the misrecognition and erasure that often bisexual individuals face. As someone who identifies as bisexual, it was important for me to express my true self and provide accurate information about my sexual orientation. However, I soon discovered that the system’s lack of knowledge and understanding about bisexuality could have serious implications for my case. During my initial interview at the Home Office, I confidently stated that I identify as bisexual. I explained that my attraction extends to multiple genders, emphasising the significance of this aspect of my identity in seeking asylum. To my surprise, I noticed that my case file had been marked as “gay,” completely disregarding and erasing my bisexual identity. This misclassification was not an administrative oversight; it reflected the misunderstanding of bisexuality and the unique experiences that bisexual asylum seekers face. It felt as though my identity was being boxed into ‘gay’.” References: ¹Multiple-attraction spectrum. ² https://www.stonewall.org.uk/bi-hub ³ https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Women-for-Refugee-Women-See-Us-Believe-Us-Stand-With-Us.pdf"
Migrants' Rights Network,Why Cypriots should stand in solidarity with refugees,23-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/23/cypriot-solidarity-refugees/,"This blog trace Cyprus’ history of displacement and being colonised, and explains how this should inform Cypriot solidarity towards refugees. Displacement + colonial legacies Cyprus is an island of displaced people and refugees. This displacement was brought about by decades of British divide and rule colonial policies, which turned the inhabitants of the island against each other along imagined ethnic lines . The conflict later culminated in a Greek coup and a Turkish invasion. Britain had a vested interest in Turkey’s invasion, as it would justify their continued military bases on the island and allow them to continue to use Cyprus as a strategic “Middle East” outpost for all their foreign policy invasions . Those responsible for this displacement and suffering have largely evaded accountability to this day. The pain of displacement has also been weaponised by White saviours , and by all those seeking to normalise the partition in Cyprus, through the presentation of fictitious historical narratives that place the blame on fellow Cypriot communities instead of on colonial or guarantor powers. Internally displaced persons Cypriots who fled Cyprus during the invasion would legally be considered refugees, since they have crossed an internationally recognised border. However displaced Cypriots who remained on the island would be considered internally displaced persons (IDPs). Even though displacement has occurred across the border shared between the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), the TRNC is not an internationally recognised state, and so the displacement does not involve an internationally recognised border, meaning that the criteria of refugeehood is not met. Both Cypriot refugees and IDPs are unable to return to their homes. Remembering Palestine In 1947, the UN passed its partition plan for Palestine. In 1948, with the end of the British Mandate over Palestine, Israel was created and the Nakba began. The Nakba refers to the ongoing genocide and displacement of Palestinians from Palestine by Israel, and the beginning of settler-colonialism by Israel. There are millions of Palestinian refugees worldwide, and many remain internally displaced within occupied Palestine, unable to ever return home. Whilst the end goal of the Zionist movement was always the colonisation of Palestine, Cyprus had also been considered for additional Zionist occupation, as a stepping stone towards this end goal, and several Zionist plans for the occupation of Cyprus were proposed to this nature. In 1939, a Zionist settlement plan was submitted to the then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and called for “the entire evacuation of the present population of Cyprus” . This differed to previous plans since Cyprus was being proposed as the location of settler colonialism instead of Palestine. These plans were refused. While these plans failed, they are important to remember. Cyprus is currently experiencing its own form of settler colonialism through the ongoing Turkish invasion and attempts at demographic change. But a hidden and widely forgotten part of our history shows us that our country could have now been the one subjected to Israeli occupation and all the displacement that has caused. Solidarity through remembering Cypriots generally have more social power by virtue of their skin tone, and are afforded greater proximity to Whiteness than other racialised communities, both originating inside and outside of the West Asia region, who have suffered and continue to suffer displacement. The notion of the “model minority” myth is also prevalent amongst Cypriot communities, and it is used to differentiate Cypriots from other racialised communities. This allows us to forget our roots, our history, and makes us aspire to Whiteness. We must remember our histories, and the ways we were treated, and how this has led us to where we are today. When we speak about solidarity, we mean standing with marginalised communities unconditionally. Solidarity is something that you extend to others at the expense of your own comfort, power and privilege. And solidarity is showing up for others, even if you have not experienced what they have. Yet there is something important and revolutionary about solidarity coming from one marginalised group, to another. This is because it is rooted in some kind of empathy , despite the differences between various struggles. It is a personally -informed understanding that we are all harmed and dehumanised by the same oppressive systems, by the same colonial legacies, and that our suffering is coming from the same place. Our liberation as displaced and colonised people can only come through solidarity with each other. Cypriots should not stand in solidarity with internally displaced people and refugees only because we have also experienced displacement. But since we know the pain of displacement through colonisation, and have experienced the history of our displacement and suffering being weaponised to suit different colonial and revisionist agendas, our solidarity should be instinctual . This is because our solidarity comes from empathy , and from a place of embodied understanding. Cyprus has a long history of progressive movements and solidarity with marginalised groups. One example of its empathy-informed solidarity was a letter in 1977 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN Secretary General , condemning the settler colonialism in occupied Palestine, and drawing parallels with the ongoing Turkish occupation of Cyprus. Today, both the TRNC and ROC are normalising relationships with Israel, despite our long history of displacement as Cypriots. Not all skin folk are kin folk. But they should be. Where is our empathy towards other racialised displaced people? Or have we denied our history so much that we have also lost our empathy? It is time to remember. by Anastasia Gavalas , MRN Comms Officer We should stand in solidarity with refugees first and foremost out of humanity- regardless of whether or not it is something familiar to us. Understanding something so detrimental, and offering a helping hand/spreading awareness is essential. For Cypriots, this should resonate deeper as our own displacement has been downplayed, and weaponised on the rare occasions that it is recognised. Sophia, a local Greek-speaking Cypriot The UN has had it’s longest peacekeeping mission in Cyprus. Communities have been/are displaced for decades, and there is a buffer zone dividing the island up until today. Cypriot people know pain very well. The right to self-determination, (true) independence, united communities and safety, are feelings that all of us long for, especially Cypriots. When my dad was forcibly displaced, they had to live in an underground cherry warehouse for a year, and they only got a dirty blanket that people use for covering oregano in order to cover themselves up. The struggle of being forcibly displaced from your own land is a pain that no one should experience. Solidarity looks like giving space for people who experienced displacement and adversity, both in the form of physical manifestation and emotional. It’s about listening to their voices and what they need. It’s about standing hand in hand together against arbitrary borders and making sure everyone has a safe and nurturing place with their own terms. For all of these reasons, and many many more, Cypriot people should be at the forefront when it comes to standing in solidarity with all displaced people, everywhere, as their pain is our pain. a Cypriot diaspora community member"
Migrants' Rights Network,"Scapegoating of migrants, Muslims + queer people: an intersectional perspective",21-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/21/scapegoating-intersectional-perspective/,"At times of domestic instability or economic hardship, demonisation of marginalised groups often increases. In the contemporary British context, the queer community, Muslims and migrants have become the latest targets of Government and right-wing scapegoating. Scapegoating and the painting of marginalised communities as “threats” are an established, and effective, distraction mechanism by those in power. Denial of racism, homophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia play a key role in scapegoating. It is used to veil the hate and discrimination that is essential in constructing the idea of a “threat” in the public consciousness. Marginalised groups are often targeted by this deflection. In the culture war that is gripping the UK, migrant groups, Muslims and the queer community have been characterised as the latest “threat” to communities and values. Characterising different marginalised groups as a “threat” is necessary for those in power to continue being in power. It is a common mechanism that states use in order to normalise the “state of exception”: where a state suspends the normal legal order by taking exceptional measures against certain communities. Measures like the inhumane Migration Bill or the Nationality and Borders Act. If there is no “threat”, there is no justification for exceptional measures to be taken. So, if a group is constructed as a “threat”, then subjecting that group to restrictive policies becomes justified in the eyes of those in power, and in the eyes of society at large. Scapegoating: refugee, migrant + migratised communities We consistently hear the argument that “it’s not racist to be worried about immigration”. We cannot ignore the fact that the characterisation of certain groups as a “threat” is inherently racialised. The racism underlying the scapegoating of migrants is constantly denied by those perpetuating that scapegoating.  Ultimately, fears around immigration stem from the fear that “Britishness” will morph into something unknown and unfamiliar. In other words, this is the racist fear of demographic change and infiltration of the ‘Other’. The language of ‘invasion’, ‘assimilation’ or ‘illegal immigrant’ demonstrates this. Now, with ‘migrant hunters’ visiting Home Office accommodation on a regular basis, we have an issue where the refugees that came to get safety are now feeling threatened and unsafe in the UK and  questioning why they came to the UK. Scapegoating of queer people: drag queens and the trans community Hateful rhetoric and scapegoating aimed at refugee and migrant communities is also being used against the queer community. In the last four years alone, anti-trans hate has skyrocketed by 156% between 2018-2022. Media and politicians alike have devoted lots of airtime to transphobic and homophobic views, with a particular emphasis on constructing the ridiculous yet harmful idea that trans women are a “threat” to cis women. Far-right demonstrations outside drag queen story times by fascist organisations like Turning Point are inherently linked to the demonstrations outside Home Office accommodation, since both are underpinned by the demonisation of marginalised communities and the attribution of social ills to the existence of these communities The intersectional relationship of queerphobia, racism and anti-migrant hate impact many communities in the UK as well as LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. It is no secret that queer asylum seekers experience systemic gaslighting and a ‘disbelief culture’ at the hands of the UK immigration system. We know from our Network that queer asylum seekers are resorting to increasingly drastic and harmful ways to prove their sexuality and/or gender identity to the Home Office. It’s time to get uncomfortable The charity and not-for-profit sector has a duty to acknowledge systems of oppression and must implement an intersectional approach in order to truly tackle injustices in society. It’s time we get comfortable having uncomfortable conversations, regardless of where we sit on the political spectrum or the work we do. That means acknowledging some uncomfortable truths that have continued to be brushed under the carpet in Britain. It’s racist to label refugees and migrants as a “threat”. It’s racist to demonstrate outside Home Office accommodation. It’s transphobic to deny trans people access to essential spaces and services. It is queerphobic to demonstrate outside drag queen storytime. Stop and unpick your prejudice. Ask yourself who is really making your life more difficult? If we are too occupied by opposing migrants and Muslims and queer people, then what is actually making your life difficult (the oppression perpetrated by the State) continues to go unchallenged."
Migrants' Rights Network,World Refugee Day,20-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/20/world-refugee-day/,"Forgotten refugees This World Refugee Day, we want to draw attention to the forgotten refugees of the world , including Palestinians, Sudanis, Syrians, Iraqis and those from the Global South. Refugees who are racialised and suffering the legacies of (settler) colonialism and imperialism are often neglected, and their plight is ignored by European society. We must remember the colonial causes of displacement, and centre the stories of those who are often left out of the conversation, including Muslim refugees and refugees with disabilities. At MRN, we look at migration through an intersectional lens, because we cannot understand the movement of people without an understanding of how people experience compounded forms of oppression beyond citizenship status. Queering “refugee” How do we stand in solidarity with refugees, especially during Pride Month? We must recognise the unique struggles of queer refugees, and the specific intersections of refugee status and queerness. But queer theory can also allow us to expand our understanding of who gets to even count as a refugee in the first place. If queerness is an orientation defiant of mainstream norms, definitions and ways of understanding the world , we can queer the label of “refugee”, and open this definition up to include those who are often left behind. How can we queer the label of “refugee”? Before we can expand our understanding of who counts as a refugee, we need to familiarise ourselves with what “refugee” actually means. A refugee is an individual whose claim for asylum has been legally recognised. It includes those who have been forcibly displaced from one country to another, due to war or conflict, or because they are being harmed or are at risk of being harmed due to a protected characteristic. As the label of “refugee” is used to denote a person whose asylum claim has been recognised, it excludes many who do not meet this criteria. We think it is important to include undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, and those whose claims have not been recognised through our refugee advocacy, since those who are barred from receiving the extra legal and societal protections afforded to refugees are denied this protection due to arbitrary legal thresholds and criteria. The label of “refugee” also does not commonly include those who have been internally displaced, since it is focused on those who are displaced across internationally recognised borders. However, the stories of internally displaced people also deserve our attention, despite the absence of an internationally recognised border being crossed. We must think about who gets the protection of being formally recognised as a “refugee”, and how this is reflective of racial hierarchies that denote some people as more worthy of protection and respect, and others as deserving of dehumanisation. We must think about how the legal category of “refugee” can be used to silence, dismiss and ostracise those who are deemed as “illegitimate”, “unworthy” or “ungenuine”, and how this reinforces an idea of humanity centred on Whiteness.

Migrants' Rights Network,What changes have there been to right to work guidance for employers?,06-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/06/changes-right-to-work-guidance/,"The intersection of employment and immigration rules are complex and right to work rules are confusing. Through the Challenge the Checks campaign, our coalition has found evidence of the damage this confusion is causing for migrant workers and employers. An essential part of this campaign is to explain this incredibly complex area in order to attempt to tackle the adverse effects on migrants. The guidance advises an employer how to conduct a right to work check and sets out the specific actions you can take to prevent liability for a civil penalty. This is called establishing a statutory excuse against liability for a penalty¹. Right to Work Guidance for Employers The Home Office has published guidance for employers’ Employer’s guide to right to work checks’ on how to conduct a right to work check. The first guidance was published by the Home Office on 16 February 2008, and followed by several new publications and amendments over the years. Since February 2008, the Home Office has amended the guidance at least 29 times. Each one of them remains relevant and employers must refer to them, where relevant. This makes it all extremely complicated, and the amendments and changes to the ‘Employer’s right to work checks guide’ can bring even more problems. Here we have listed some of the most important and major changes that have been made, and how they have impacted workers. Proving right to work The biggest challenge came about through the 2014 changes. If you have valid leave to remain in an expired passport, it is now not acceptable as proof of right to work.  A current and valid passport had to be used². This has meant people have had to renew their passports by applying for a biometric residence permit and pay additional fees to prove their ‘right to work’ so the employer can establish a statutory excuse. There are also cases of people being told they can no longer remain employed because their passport has expired, and have been wrongly and ‘illegally’ terminated from their jobs because of this change. Since July 2015, BRPs are the only evidence of lawful residence currently issued by the Home Office to most non-EEA nationals and their dependents granted permission to remain in the UK for more than 6 months. But in April 2022, another significant change took place with Biometric Residence Card (BRC), Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) and Frontier Worker Permit (FWP) holders. These documents have been completely removed from the list of acceptable documents. It means that employers cannot accept or check a physical BRC, BRP or FWP as proof of right to work. This is in spite of the Home Office advising employers to perform a manual ‘right to work’ check. We assume this huge and substantial change is as a result of the move to a digital status only for current and future visa/BRP holders but the Home Office never says why they make these changes and why there are so many changes in a short period of time. In the 2018 amendments, the guidance states that employers are required to use the Home Office online checking service when carrying out a right to work check in order to establish a statutory excuse. This reflects the amendment brought in by the Immigration [Restriction on Employment]. Here is the issue: one the one hand, the law says that workers who have permission to work can work, and they are not required to evidence their right to work to employers, but on the other hand, the Home Office tells the employer they have to do a right to work check either using the online checking service or via a manual check, but they cannot legally force the worker to do the right to work check. There is no legal requirement to do so. In addition, in the Employer’s guide to right to work checks, the Home Office tells workers, especially asylum seekers and British and Irish citizens, that some immigration documents issued by the Home Office are valid immigration documents which they can use to evidence their right to work, even if it is expired. However, at the same time in another bit of guidance, the Home Office tells employers that they cannot establish a statutory excuse because the same documents are not “trusted documents”. This is all the result of unnecessarily complex Home Office policy which states that while the leave itself is valid, it has to be in a current document for it to be accepted as part of a right to work check. The Home Office has not made this clear. These are just a few of the issues and contradictions that exist in the system which can have devastating impacts on migrant workers. Case study: Miss W Sims v The London Borough of Lewisham and Governing Body of Adamsrill Primary School Miss W Sims (an American national) claimed she was unfairly dismissed and experienced race discrimination in April 2018. She was asked to provide evidence of her right to work through a DBS check. She produced a number of documents including an expired American passport which contained her indefinite leave to remain (IRL) stamp. Her current passport did not contain this stamp. She had previously been told that her old passport with ILR stamp could be used as evidence and her status could not be revoked.  At this time, the DBS system would not allow them to move beyond the visa section and she did not possess a Biometric Residents Permit (BRP) at that time. The employer dismissed her because of “her inability to satisfy” the right to work check. The school’s Human Resources department also told her that the claimant and her mother were “illegal immigrants”, that her American passport was forged and that she had been “evading the authorities”. Upon dismissal in April 2018, Miss W Sims contacted the Citizens Advice Bureau on the same day and made multiple efforts to seek assistance, but was advised before any employment tribunal, she should first resolve her immigration status. This advice was made despite a three-month time limit to bring a claim. As a result, her local MP wrote to the Home Office on her behalf recommending that the fee for a biometric residency permit (BRP) be waived. Almost ten months later, she received her BRP following an application to the Windrush taskforce. Over those ten months, she suffered financial hardship and did not receive any benefits until March 2019. She noted during the trial that she was terrified immigration enforcement would arrest her for being “illegal in the country”. The Tribunal found in favour of Miss W Sims and was awarded the sum of £18,000 as compensation. ¹Home Office , Employer’s guide to rights to work checks –  each guidance starts with this sentence on the very first page ‘about the guidance’. ²These require an employer to accept only leave (For example, documents which contain an expiry date must now be current (except those showing that the holder is a British citizen, a citizen of the UK and Colonies having the right of abode, a national of an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland or their family members with permanent residence).for example Indefinite Leave to Remain). This creates a problem for those who hold an Immigration Status Document issued by the Home Office before November 2008, which was  in a current passport."

Migrants' Rights Network,Pride must continue its revolt,01-Jun-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/06/01/pride-must-continue-revolt/,"The first Pride was a revolt by Black and Brown, trans and queer people against state-sanctioned racism and queerphobia. This is why police, immigration enforcement officials and any kind of oppressive institutions must not be welcomed at Pride, for the safety of Black, Brown, migratised, undocumented and queer communities. We can clearly see how migrant, racialised and queer communities are all painted as an inherent “unassimilable” “threat” to the so-called Western way of life, and how these attacks against multiple marginalised groups have come to be a defining feature of the far-right. This can perhaps embolden us to continue to build bonds between different marginalised groups, since our struggles are all intertwined . Borders will always exclude those not deemed worthy enough, whether they be queer, racialised, migratised or otherwise. This is why solidarity is so important. Our politics must be intersectional: single-issue politics are an injustice to all marginalised people. At a time when the Home Secretary has bashed the left for being “ashamed of our history” , it is worthwhile remembering which histories we should be proud of: histories of resistance by marginalised groups. But it is also worth remembering the shameful parts of our history: colonialism and its homophobic legacy . There is NO Pride in that. Racialised and migratised communities have ALWAYS been at the forefront of queer liberation. They have always resisted border violence, gentrification, police brutality and surveillance. It is imperative to remember these beautifully powerful histories of queerness, and to honour them everyday. We can do this by understanding that queerness, race and class are interconnected, and always have been. Only through intersectionality can we understand the systems of oppression that shape the way the State and society treat people seeking safety or a new life."
Migrants' Rights Network,Migration Figures: Statement,25-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/25/migration-figures-statement/,"Today’s migration figures show 606,000 in numbers and the anti-migrant rhetoric has increased with it. We cannot and should not view people coming here to support our economies and sectors as a disposable number. The Government is driving its agenda to convince us that there are “too many migrants”- which is both inflammatory and untrue. This idea has come straight from the scapegoating playbook. Migrant communities are not a threat that needs to be dealt with. They are not a drain on the UK’s resources or public services. In fact without them, the NHS would likely have collapsed long ago. The criticism should remain focused on the Government’s austerity policies and welfare cuts, which deprive all of our communities of resources and the public services we need."
Migrants' Rights Network,National Conservatism Conference,24-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/24/national-conservatism-conference-statement/,"The controversial National Conservatism Conference took place last week and was essentially a showcase of everything we’re fighting at the Migrants’ Rights Network: scapegoating and a demonisation of minorities, including People of Colour and migrants. There was no shortage of inflammatory racist statements being made, including Suella showcasing her ongoing obsession with the ethnicity of grooming gangs. She had previously claimed in an interview with Sky News that grooming gang members are “almost all British-Pakistani” . She has already been called out for her offensive words, yet she continues to spin this dangerously false narrative, despite Home Office statistics showing that group-based Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) offenders are most commonly White . In stating that “nobody should be blamed for things that happened before they were born”, her words also showed a deep denial of Britain’s role in the enslavement of people from the African continent. Britain’s involvement always occurred in the colonised outposts as opposed to at home. This means it was rarely witnessed, and the UK could always pretend it wasn’t happening, distance itself from this atrocity, and shirk any responsibility for practising it. Our Government panders to White guilt by absolving White people from interrogating and reflecting on their own privilege, and sordid history. Suella stated that “those on the left are ashamed of our history”. We wonder how someone could remain so delusionally unashamed, especially when history continues to benefit those in power at the expense of racialised communities. The Conference also played into moral panic surrounding the “decline” of “Western civilisation” and “demographic change”. Not only does this reference the transphobic, homophobic and misogynist obsession with “normative families” that demonises single-parent families, but it also reveals a deeply racist anti-migrant sentiment which alludes to the Great Replacement Theory. We can clearly see how migrant, racialised and queer communities are all painted as an inherent “unassimilable” “threat” to the so-called Western way of life, and how these attacks against multiple marginalised groups have come to be a defining feature of the far-right. This can perhaps embolden us to continue to build bonds between different marginalised groups, since our struggles are all intertwined. At MRN, we look at migration and migration policies through an intersectional lens. Without this approach, we cannot truly understand the systems of oppression that shape the way the State treats people seeking safety or a new life. We have to acknowledge the role that racism and colonialism play in defining who is welcome. The Government believes that those fighting for progressive change view “the purpose of politics as to eradicate the existence of inequality, even if that comes at the expense of individual liberty and human flourishing.” We wonder why the Government is so content to fixate on “individual liberty” for the powerful few, at the expense of everyone else’s flourishing."
Migrants' Rights Network,Asylum accommodation: what’s going on?,19-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/19/accommodation-asylum/,"The question of where to accommodate newly arrived people in the UK or people who are awaiting Home Office decisions has been a contentious one for some time. Hostility has been simmering away about the use of hotels and now seems to be at a boiling point. In March, Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, announced Government plans to “significantly reduce the number of people requiring accommodation in hotels.” As part of the reforms, the Government has said it will repurpose surplus military sites and explore the use of vessels in line with approaches taken in the Netherlands and Scotland. What will these sites look like and what will the impact be? The age of camps and floating prisons The Government has identified a few initial sites to accommodate new arrivals. These include the Northeye Residential and Training Establishment in Bexhill, the Ministry of Defence Wethersfield in Braintree, Essex, RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire and the Bibby Stockholm Vessel in Portland Port. The Government has claimed they are using vessels to accommodate people based on previous schemes in countries like the Netherlands. However, when barges have previously been used as accommodation, there was a massive health and safety breach where raw sewage leaked into their drinking water supplies. The Typhoid outbreak infected 72 people who needed immediate treatment. Source: The Evening Standard The 222-bedroom Bibby Stockholm is one such vessel and has been previously described as an ‘oppressive environment’. It is a 1970s-built barge which the Government will use to accommodate 500 male asylum seekers- double the number it was originally planned for. On 9th May 2023, it was reported that the barge had arrived in Cornwall for ‘assessment’ before being moved to the Isle of Portland, and the first group being accommodated will arrive there in June. The implementation of this vessel comes in spite of widespread opposition from all sides of the political spectrum. Here at MRN, our vehement opposition to this proposal is in relation to the conditions those accommodated there will face, and the negative impact such isolating circumstances may have on people seeking safety. The safety and wellbeing of those residing there are rarely if ever taken into consideration, and the Government is using new measures to make it easier for asylum accommodation to circumvent health and safety measures. Crammed housing The Government will introduce a temporary licensing exemption to houses of multiple occupancy (HMO) regulations for asylum seekers. In other words, landlords will be able to fill homes with large numbers of people in properties not designed to house so many people. HMO regulations were introduced to prevent properties becoming hazardous specifically in the event of fire , and we have seen the deadly and tragic results including when a young man who perished in a fire where 18 people were residing in a two-bedroom flat. In addition, the Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, recently stated that asylum seekers would be housed in the “most basic accommodation possible” and would meet the legal requirements to ensure people were not made “destitute” but “nothing more”. According to the Asylum Accommodation and Support Statement of Requirements (Schedule 2), General Accommodation requirements state that: 2.1.1 The Provider shall provide safe, habitable, fit for purpose and correctly equipped Accommodation in areas agreed with the Authority, including appropriate related services for those Service users . With the law requiring asylum accommodation to meet certain standards, Jenrick’s statement exposes the hostility towards people seeking safety and the segregated refugee system that has taken hold in the UK. Whilst the Government introduced the ‘Homes for Ukraine’ scheme and encouraged the population to open their doors to White Ukrainians, people forced to come via irregular routes from the Global South are treated with suspicion and placed into prison-like accommodation. During the week commencing 15th May 2023, Parliament is debating the issue of HMO for asylum accommodation. Local opposition: what is the real reason? Plans in Lincolnshire to turn RAF Scampton into asylum accommodation has garnered considerable criticism amongst the local community. At a public meeting this week, residents were told it would be men from Afghanistan, Libya and “them sort of areas” . Local MPs have criticised Government plans to accommodate asylum seekers in their constituencies. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh MP criticised plans around RAF Scampton while Richard Drax MP has said he will support Dorset Council if they choose to take action against the Government’s plans to put asylum seekers on a barge . Despite failed legal challenges ( in the case of RAF Scampton ), the strength of local opposition hasn’t faded. Nor is it a sentiment that is unique to the UK. If we are to understand why there is so much hostility towards accepting asylum seekers both in the UK and across Europe, we must analyse who this opposition is aimed towards. For example, when White Ukrainians arrived in the UK, many opened their homes to them. Yet when plans are made to accommodate refugees of Colour in a community, the welcome is not quite so enthusiastic. These plans to accommodate refugees and asylum seekers in unsuitable and potentially dangerous accommodation is putting their lives at risk, and they face being retraumatised. Everyone deserves to be part of a community: the Government must support people seeking sanctuary and enable them to set down roots in their new communities. However, we have reached a point where indifference and hostility towards people seeking safety has reached such intensity that we are largely content to see people put in camps or floating prisons. How can we claim to be a compassionate country when we are prepared to do things we are so quick to condemn in other parts of the world? Britain’s record on human rights has always been weak, but we are set on a worrying path that will destroy any measly claim of upholding rights and dignity. Sign our petition to end the Government’s cruel plans for inhumane asylum accommodation."
Migrants' Rights Network,Multiculturalism and inclusion are not things to be feared,15-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/15/multiculturalism-and-inclusion/,"Multiculturalism and inclusion are not things to be feared. Yet the Home Secretary and Government’s divisive rhetoric on migration is alienating certain groups of people while failing to address systemic and structural causes of discrimination. We must remember that these are not caused by multiculturalism, but by the State. The Home Secretary’s comments at the National Conservatism Conference highlight the problems with the narrative of ‘integration’ . The subtext of this is that they expect migrants to give up important parts of their identity, language or culture in order to be accepted and worthy of rights. It reinforces the dangerous idea that migration is ultimately a threat to the perception of ‘unity’. In an increasingly hostile environment, it is important to ask how we can expect ‘integration’ when some migrants and refugees do not enjoy the same rights and privileges that others do. “As a migrant in this country, we have limited and conditional access to some fundamental rights and are then told we are not integrating enough. We are seen as economically valuable while ‘taking’ from British people.  We cannot win.”"
Migrants' Rights Network,Immigration Acts 2014 + 2016,12-May-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/05/12/immigration-acts-anniversary/,"The Immigration Act of 2014 received Royal Assent on 14 May 2014, almost nine years ago. The Immigration Act of 2016 received Royal Assent on 12 May 2016, exactly seven years ago. On the anniversaries of these two Acts, we must reflect on their legacy, and on the history that made them possible. In 2012, Theresa May announced her plans for the Hostile Environment: to create a living hell for undocumented migrants by restricting or denying their access to basic rights and public services through the threat of removal. Many have lived in fear of, or have been subjected to forced removal as a result of the Hostile Environment. In 2014, the Immigration Act further codified hostility towards racialised and migratised communities. It is one of the main causes of the Windrush Scandal, showing Black British people that their belonging was always conditional. The Immigration Act of 2016 further extended surveillance against and restricted the rights of migratised communities. Since then, we have seen even more cruel policies being planned and enacted. The Nationality + Borders Act, the Rwanda Deportation Deal, the inhumane Migration Bill and the plans to put asylum seekers in inhumane accommodation make it imperative that we continue to stand in solidarity with migrants and refugees. These Acts are all connected by a thread of anti-immigrant, racist rhetoric. The Hostile Environment is the immediate predecessor to these laws, but it is important to remember that migratised and racialised communities have suffered at the hands of the British state long before Theresa May’s 2012 speech that ushered in the Hostile Environment. By the Government’s own admission in their Equality Impact Assessment, the Hostile Environment treats people differently on the basis of race, and disproportionately impacts People of Colour. This proves the interconnected nature of immigration control and racism."

Migrants' Rights Network,We reject the Immigration Minister’s inflammatory remarks.,26-Apr-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/04/26/we-reject-immigration-minister-inflammatory-remarks/,"We completely reject the Immigration Minister’s divisive comments on migrants and people arriving in the UK. At a time where hostility towards refugees and migrants is growing, his remarks are irresponsible and further vindicates the far-right. The Home Secretary has now added to Jenrick’s dehumanising narrative by drawing links between migrants and refugees and “drug dealing, exploitation (and) prostitution.” The ludicrous claim that migrants have different lifestyles and values is another route to scapegoat and vilify people seeking safety.  The Immigration Minister’s comments are part of a wider problem with terms such as cohesion, integration and assimilation, which cement the idea that migrants and racialised communities have to give up important elements of their identity or culture in order to be accepted. These ideas rest on divisive and racist ideas in order to thrive. In other words, it weaponises the problematic idea of ‘us vs. them’ and incites widespread fear of the ‘Other’. The Immigration Minister’s comments insinuate that our acceptance of people is conditional and must play into the preconceived idea of what is considered to be ‘respectable’. These ideas have a historic and complex relationship with the UK’s immigration policies from the 1905 Aliens Act to the inhumane Migration Bill working its way through Parliament. Integration, cohesion and assimilation draw upon the concept of who is deemed to be welcome, and who is not. Furthermore, the use of the term cannibalise is a pointed and racist term drenched in colonial-era ideas, specifically about People of Colour. It is a racist term which draws on the colonial stereotype of people from the Global South as “savages”. Unity is only threatened when groups are pitted against each other. We call on the Immigration Minister to withdraw his inflammatory remarks."
Migrants' Rights Network,The Hostile Environment goes digital,18-Apr-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/04/18/digital-hostile-environment-2/,"The Digital Hostile Environment is growing. The Government’s crackdown on the rights of migrants and refugees spans many areas of everyday life. The Immigration Minister has recently announced plans that data sharing with the financial sector will begin as the Government cracks down on so-called “illegal migrants” accessing banking services. In a Government press release, the announcement states that the Home Office will share details of disqualified people via an anti-fraud organisation. Furthermore, banks and building societies will then check personal current account holders against those details. At the Migrants’ Rights Network, migrants’ data and digital rights has been a key campaigning area for a long time. At the end of last year, Rishi Sunak announced that the policy of data sharing with banks would be resurrected. From our previous work in this area, we knew that life was about to get even harder for migrants. These checks were introduced back in 2016 under the Immigration Act but were paused in 2018 by then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid in light of the Windrush scandal. The Government claims that having access to a current account can assist those working “unlawfully” in obtaining work “illegally and securing credit”. However, we know that these plans are riddled with technical errors and could have devastating consequences on the lives of migrant communities. An independent investigation in 2016 where they discovered an error rate of 10%. They found people listed incorrectly as ‘disqualified persons’ from a sample of accounts (ICIBI, 2016). Families with different immigration statuses will be negatively impacted by this policy and having a bank account closed can have huge ramifications for someone’s ability to work, live and thrive. In addition, these plans raise the important question of who is considered to be welcome in the UK, particularly at a time where the Government is intent on restricting ways to come to the UK and constructing the idea of the ‘illegal migrant’. Along with our partners and migrant communities in our Network, we will renew our calls for these data sharing plans between the Home Office and the banking sector for the purpose of immigration enforcement to be stopped. These plans are part of the Government’s focus on deterrence rather than helping people arriving in the UK to start a new life and tackling many of the barriers that exist for them to do so.

Migrants' Rights Network,The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill harms migrants’ rights,05-Apr-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/04/05/digital-hostile-environment/,"As part of the Challenge the Checks campaign , the Migrants’ Rights Network, Migrants at Work and the Open Rights Group are investigating how the hostile environment is negatively impacting migrant workers. As part of this work, we are looking at the intersection of data and employment rights. From the Windrush scandal, which resulted in the wrongful detention and deportation of hundreds of people, to the cruel and unjust Inhumane Migration Bill which is currently making its way through Parliament, the UK Government has continually pushed inhumane policies that endanger migrants. These hostile policies have increasingly overlapped with the digital space. While building a vast digital infrastructure of surveillance and data collection across law enforcement, housing, and benefits systems, the Home Office has said that it aims to be operating a “fully digital system” for all migrants by 2024. These systems present serious risks to migrants’ privacy, data security, and access to important services. In addition, the Data Protection Act 2018 denies migrants their full data rights through the ‘immigration exemption’. This allows the Home Office and private companies to refuse requests by individuals for access to personal data held about them on the grounds that it might “prejudice the maintenance of effective immigration control”. The Open Rights Group (ORG) and the3million have taken the Government to court twice over this exemption. Recently, the High Court agreed that this exemption is incompatible with the General Data Protection Regulation. This is a significant victory in challenging the digital hostile environment that the Government is trying to create but there are further threats ahead as the UK Government attempts to weaken privacy and data protection through the Data Protection and Digital Information (DPDI) Bill. The legislation, if passed, will increase surveillance while weakening data rights. This blog sets out a few ways the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill would negatively impact migrant workers: New exemptions for ‘national security’ and ‘crime prevention’ – the Bill has added new exemptions for re-sharing data without consent that include vague purposes like “sharing data for national security” and “crime prevention”. These exemptions are likely to result in significant re-sharing of data about vulnerable groups like migrants among Government bodies and will make it much harder to challenge the Government’s retention and repurposing of data. Changing the threshold for Subject Access Requests (SARs)– SARs allow individuals to request a copy of all of the data that a business or the Government hold about them. This can include a copy of the data, how they are using it, who they are sharing it with and where they got it from. The Bill would make it easier for the Government or businesses to deny SARs by migrant workers, which is extremely concerning as SARs are a key tool for helping people track their data and understand when it has been misused. The Government has moved toward using solely digital-based proof of immigration status. However, when the Home Office decides that a person no longer has the right to be in the UK, individuals are prevented from working and accessing key services. The changes to SARs in the DPDI Bill will make it more difficult for individuals to find out what data is held about them so that they can remedy mistakes. Changes to Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) – DPIAs are an essential process within the Government and businesses where they have to systematically analyse, identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project or plan before undertaking it. DPIAs are especially important in cases where the data being processed is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Despite this, the Bill makes changes to DPIAs, reducing the requirements to conduct one before processing people’s data and removing the requirement to consult with individuals who might be impacted by the use of their data. It is critical to hear from individuals themselves about how the use of their data could negatively impact them, so this change greatly limits the effectiveness of DPIAs. A loss of proper DPIAs also makes it harder for civil society organisations to scrutinise, inform and advise on proposed automated systems before, during and after their implementation. The changes to DPIAs will particularly impact migrant workers due to the increased use of facial recognition systems and automated visa making algorithms. A host of research shows that AI technologies have serious vulnerabilities, are systemically biased, and are applied in ways that exacerbate racial inequality. Without proper safeguards, these technologies have a disproportionate impact on marginalised communities who already face increased risk of immigration stops and right to work checks. The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill will weaken the UK’s data protection infrastructure and, crucially, leave civil society and migrant workers with fewer tools with which to demand accountability. Unfettered surveillance and data sharing among Government agencies and private companies presents a real risk of the data being used to profile, manipulate and discriminate against migrants. Additionally, an environment of increased impunity for companies and Government officials will further discourage migrant workers from accessing necessary healthcare or reporting workplace abuses. While imperfect, the current UK GDPR is one of the strongest data protection laws in the world and provides many important rights. These include the right to access data being held about you, protection against solely automated decision-making, structures for corporate accountability, and limitations on the repurposing of data. These rights are essential for empowering individuals in an data ecosystem where the government and companies hold immense power. We strongly urge the Government to drop the DPDI Bill and begin again with a legislative process that centers the rights of individuals and works to ensure the most equitable and positive outcomes for society. by Abigail Burke, Policy Manager for Data Protection at the Open Rights Group"
Migrants' Rights Network,Statement on inappropriate refugee accommodation,30-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/30/statement-inappropriate-refugee-accommodation/,"The Government’s plans to put people seeking safety in non-housing accommodation, including offshore accommodation- ships, ferries and barrages- and military accommodation, is deeply alarming. These are not appropriate nor solutions to hotels. These plans are a cruel way of singling out and othering people seeking safety, making them an even bigger target for hate. Isolating people seeking safety from the wider community will cause a detrimental impact to their physical and mental well-being. The only path forward is ensuring that those who risk everything to come to this country are supported with safe housing that meets their needs. We want the Government to work closely with local authorities and supporting organisations to create local solutions with the proper resources. Everyone deserves to be part of a community: the Government must support people seeking sanctuary, and enable them to set down roots in their new communities.

Migrants' Rights Network,Commonwealth Day: Our Statement,13-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/13/commonwealth-day-statement/,"The Commonwealth is an extension of the British Empire under the disguise of liberal multiculturalism. It placates us with its promises of “unity” and “equality”, whilst the wealth it purports as being universal remains concentrated in the hands of the beneficiaries of Empire. As Kojo Koram would say, it is an enduring symbol of “Uncommon Wealth” . When we speak of wealth, we do not just speak of financial or material wealth, but also the spiritual wealth and richness that we, and all people from colonised countries, have been denied. People are well aware of physical colonisation (the colonisation of territories), but what is often left understudied is the effects of colonisation on the mind. Colonialism has distorted our understanding of ourselves, our histories and our identities, has threatened elements of our culture and heritage, and has literally subjected people to intense psychological trauma through forcible displacement and conflict. At its root, colonisation is about dehumanisation, and unfortunately, these dehumanising narratives can become internalised by the people subjected to them, which has massive psychological repercussions. The Commonwealth and its empty symbolism remains a distraction from the legacies of pillaging, decimation, violent erasure and partition that the British Empire left behind. The Commonwealth does nothing to address contemporary global wealth inequities, or the psychological scars that remain across our communities and across generations. We write this statement as two individuals with heritage from “formerly” colonised, Commonwealth countries: Pakistan and Cyprus respectively. Naturally, our lived experiences will differ, as those with heritage from the Commonwealth are not homogenous. Yet our commonality remains that we have been and continue to be colonised through imperialist means, and we are still seen and treated as less than. Both our communities were dehumanised, racialised, used as pawns in British civilising missions, and both our communities continue to suffer the lasting effects of British divide and rule. We reject this call for “unity” under the terms that colonisers have set for us. We instead envision a solidarity amongst colonised Global South communities, that looks towards healing and liberation. We will never be free under coloniser frameworks or institutions, and so we must cultivate our own. by Fizza Qureshi + Anastasia Gavalas"
Migrants' Rights Network,What’s going on with the UK’s immigration laws?,10-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/10/whats-going-on-with-immigration-laws/,"Immigration law and asylum has been in the news a lot recently. You might be finding it hard to get your head around what’s going on, so we’ve put together this little summary to help. At the end of last year, the Prime Minister stood up in Parliament and announced his five point plan for tackling ‘small boat’ arrivals. 1.Asylum, small boats and deportations At the end of last year, the Government hinted that tougher measures for tackling arrivals by ‘small boats’ would be coming in early 2023. This week, we got a sense of what those plans will be in the form of the ‘Illegal Migration’ Bill . In a nutshell, the Government is attempting to effectively criminalise anyone who comes to the country through an irregular route, such as crossing the English Channel. In a statement, the Home Secretary said they will detain and “swiftly remove” anyone entering via these means. People will either be removed back to their country of origin if the Government deems it safe or to a “safe third country like Rwanda”. They are trying to use this new Bill to place a legal duty on the Home Secretary to remove people and reduce the number of challenges and appeals that can suspend removal. Other measures include: The creation of a new Small Boats Operational Command with over 700 new staff. Doubling of National Crime Agency (NCA) funding to tackle smuggling gangs and signed a deal with Albania to enable the return of “illegal arrivals” i.e. vulnerable people seeking safety and a new life Enabling detention without bail or judicial review within the first 28 days of detention until they can be removed Procurement of accommodation including military land to end the practice of using hotels to accommodate people arriving in the UK While the emphasis has been on small boats, this Bill will be focused on cracking down on all forms of unauthorised routes including smuggling via lorries. There are probably a few reasons why the Government is focusing so much energy on small boats. Sunak’s predecessors faced a lot of pressure from Tory MPs to tackle the issue of small boats and previous Home Secretary, Priti Patel, tried to come up with some “magic solution”. This included putting a processing centre on an isolated volcanic island in the South Atlantic before the now infamous Rwanda plan was announced. Legislation like this is doomed to fail while increasing the suffering of refugees because it places the emphasis on deterrence rather than acknowledging the real underlying issues impacting the UK’s asylum system. The majority of displaced people do not come to the UK. The majority remain in their country of origin or neighbouring countries, while those that do come to Europe claim asylum with our European neighbours. Germany, for example, takes three times the number of refugees that the UK does. What we are seeing unfold is the age-old tactic of scapegoating immigrants to distract from numerous Government policy failures such as NHS waiting times or the cost-of-living crisis. It is also placing the blame for the issues in the asylum system on the asylum seekers, rather than taking accountability for the mess they have made. The asylum backlog is more than ten times bigger than it was in 2010. There are many reasons for this including administrative problems, inadequate training, low morale and high staff turnover. 2. Immigration enforcement Alongside the Government’s new favourite “stop the boats” phrase, the Prime Minister also committed to a renewed focus on immigration enforcement. This included a pledge to boost raids on “illegal working”, hiring 200 new Immigration Enforcement staff and restarting data sharing with banks to ensure people don’t have access to bank accounts. The Home Office has launched Operation Brycem which will focus on people working without permission in the care sector. They have already started raids on care homes in spite of the fact that we have a significant shortage of labour in the health and care sector, and these raids will significantly impact the wellbeing of those needing care. At the end of January, the Government published a press release which stated there had been a 10% rise in the number of enforcement visits since 11 December 2022 totalling 1,152 raids. As hostile rhetoric and policies are becoming more embedded, community resistance is swiftly becoming the strongest form of opposition. Anti-Raids Networks and CopWatch are helping spread the word about raids happening in communities across the UK. They directly intervene with raids and try to distribute information and legal support in communities targeted by enforcement. At the Migrants’ Rights Network, we worked with allies across the sector to compile a Know Your Rights Guide which includes vital information on banking and the hostile environment, exploitation and knowing your digital rights. 3. Digital Hostile Environment Data Protection and Digital Information Bill There are additional measures being introduced by the Government  to weaken data protection rights. Our partners at the Open Rights Group are helping to lead opposition to the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill . Legislation will reduce proper oversight of data processing, jeopardise sensitive information about UK residents and create new opportunities for discrimination against marginalised groups.. Protections for workers, women, racialised groups, migrants and the LGBTQ+ community by the UK GDPR and 2018 Data Protection Act are essential to making the UK an equitable place to live. The public has shown support for more robust regulation of data-driven technologies such as protection against surveillance, unfair dismissals, data misuses by law enforcement and against the exploitation of medical conditions for commercial purposes. Digital Right to Work checks Migrants face a wealth of issues exacerbated by the digital hostile environment. Recently, there has been another update to the Right to Work checks guide produced by the Home Office. This time they have included those individuals with an outstanding, in-time application for permission to stay in the UK, or an appeal, or Administrative Review (3C leave) to have this reflected in their digital profile, and will not need to prove their right to work using the Home Office online checking service. However, we know in practice that many employers do not understand that holding Section 3c leave entitles someone to continue working in the UK. Also, this change is only reflected for those who applied after 26 January 2023, and others will have to continue to use the Home Office’s online checking service. And, we know that digital right to work checks are riddled with issues. The Government’s online checking service has been identified as holding incorrect information such as showing someone else’s status, wrongly showing someone else’s status, wrongly showing a status as pending or showing an error message. In some cases this has resulted in unfair dismissal or job offers being revoked. If you want to learn more about how these checks impact lives, please read here .

Migrants' Rights Network,It’s racist to…,06-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/06/its-racist-to/,"It’s racist to stand outside a hotel and intimidate refugees. It’s racist to claim refugees are a ‘threat’ to local communities. It’s racist to tell people to ‘go back to where they came from’. It’s racist to blame a lack of local resources on people seeking sanctuary. Demonstrations outside hotels accommodating refugees are increasing. We must acknowledge the role of Islamophobia and racism in creating and sustaining anti-migrant sentiment. The majority of people in Home Office accommodation are from majority Muslim countries and are People of Colour, often from the SWANA region (South West Asia and North Africa). These communities were once painted as a ‘threat’ in order to justify colonisation, and these same narratives are now being used as a means to subject these communities to hostile immigration policies. The Government is using refugees as scapegoats for their policy failings. They are fueling the flames with inflammatory language, and offering the far-right fodder in order to incite disenfranchised working class communities to hatred. Working class communities have more in common with refugees and migrants than they do with those in power. It’s time they realised this.

Migrants' Rights Network,Britain is an expert in homonationalistic ideology,01-Mar-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/03/01/britain-expert-homonationalistic-ideology/,"As LGBT History Month comes to a close, we must reflect on how far we have come, and how far we have yet to go. It’s also a time to shed light on many of the issues facing LGBTQ+ people. Beyond the pinkwashing and corporate dominated Pride events, there are still many issues facing the community that don’t get the attention they need. At the Migrants’ Rights Network, we reject single issue politics and believe that migration and refugee issues should be examined through the lens of compounded identities. As a very intersectional team, we know that the structures that oppress migrants and refugees are part of the same system of oppression that leads to queerphobia and transphobia. LGBTQ+ issues have been weaponised in recent years by the State and media to justify exclusionary or aggressive policies. This is the concept of ‘homonationalism’. Homonationalism was a concept proposed by Jasbir Puar in 2007 which argues Western LGBT movements are often bound up with upholding the racist ideology of the State . Specifically, it is a method by which the State uses sexuality to legitimise counterterrorism or exclusionary measures against Muslims or People of Colour. The concept relies on Orientalist ideologies as the West as inherently progressive who must unite against ‘backwards’, ‘inherently homophobic’ groups, which in contemporary discourse usually fixates on Muslim people . Britain is an expert in homonationalistic ideology. As Queer people, it’s incredibly frustrating to see the LGBTQ+ community appropriated to further harmful immigration policies. It is also detrimental to the continued struggle for rights and equality to assume that Queer liberation has been achieved in the UK. We are absolutely not living in a Queer utopia where we coexist harmoniously with cis-hetereo people. Queer-only spaces are a necessary lifeline because they are inherently safe. Prejudice, hate and gaslighting are still rampant. LGBTQ+ people are subjected to gaslighting or stereotyping while queer asylum seekers are subjected to invasive and traumatic treatment by immigration enforcement. Many face detention and deportation. by Julia, Policy & Strategic Comms Manager at MRN"
Migrants' Rights Network,How Britain exported homophobia,24-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/24/homophobia-british-empire-export/,"It is arguably true that the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community, including homophobia and transphobia, has a long and painful history that is deeply rooted in the legacy of white supremacy and colonialism. The impact of British imperialism on the lives of LGBTQ+ people in their colonies is immeasurable, and its devastating effects continue to be felt to this day. It’s a little-known fact that prior to the arrival of the British colonial regime, many indigenous tribes in Africa and Asia were accepting people of same-sex intimacy and gender variance. For example, the Igbo and Yoruba tribes in Nigeria, as well as the Dagaaba people of Ghana, assigned gender later in life, not at birth. Meanwhile, the Imbangala people of Angola recognized men in women’s clothing as a cultural norm. However, the introduction of anti-gay legislation by British colonisers in India in 1861 , marked a significant turning point for the LGBTQ+ community. These laws, which were imposed on colonised territories in an attempt to set “standards of behaviour,” led to widespread discrimination and persecution, as well as marginalisation and stigmatisation. They not only undermined personal privacy and freedom but also created an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. Sadly, out of the 69 countries where homosexuality is criminalised today, 36 of them are former British colonies . Many commonwealth African nations, for instance, still hold onto the colonial-era legislation and attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community from a commonwealth country in Africa, I know firsthand the challenges we face in society, including discrimination, persecution, and marginalisation. In my country, being gay or transgender is still considered a crime, punishable by 14 years imprisonment. The societal pressure to conform to “traditional” gender roles and heteronormativity forces many LGBTQ+ individuals to hide their identities or face persecution and violence from their families and communities. Not only are we denied basic human rights, such as access to employment, healthcare and education, there is little or no protection in the law from persecution and harassment. Injustice, inhospitable hostile welcome for LGBTQ+ For many LGBTQ+ people, the only hope of escape from this persecution is to seek asylum in other countries. However, the UK’s hostile environment policies have made the asylum process a daunting and almost impossible task for many. As an LGBTQ+ asylum seeker, I know how difficult it can be to seek protection in the UK, especially given the “culture of disbelief” among decision-makers (DMs). Many LGBTQ+ asylum seekers are rejected because DMs do not consider them to be persecuted or at risk of persecution in their home country. The Home Office has even demanded “proof of sexuality” from asylum seekers, making it even more difficult for LGBTQ+ individuals to gain protection. The demand to provide ‘proof’ is hindered by the Home Office’s limited understanding of sexuality and lack of nuance. Sexuality is still largely seen by DM’s, and indeed wider society, as simply falling into ‘gay’ or ‘straight’. While it is of course traumatic and difficult for gay asylum seekers to apply for protection, a lack of knowledge and stereotypes around bisexuality, pansexuality or fluid sexuality makes it difficult to be believed. The prevailing ‘disbelief culture’ reflects a broader inhospitable environment for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. For individuals within the LGBTQ+ community who are seeking asylum, we face significant barriers to prove our sexual identity and providing the necessary evidence to support our claims. Living in secret and fearing the consequences of being outed, many LGBTQ+ people do not have the concrete evidence necessary to be granted protection. There is a contrast between having to hide your sexuality or identity in your country of origin to protect yourself, yet in the UK you have to amplify it in order to be given protection. Furthermore, the long waiting periods and inability to receive benefits, work, open bank accounts etc, places LGBTQ+ individuals seeking asylum in the UK are at risk of abuse, exploitation, and destitution. The recent introduction of the Nationality and Borders Act , which requires higher standards of evidence, has only made it more difficult for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to prove their sexuality. We must demand better treatment for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers in the UK, including more hospitable and just asylum processes that do not rely on “proof of sexuality”. This is dehumanising.  We must also support local activists in their struggle for the decriminalisation of homosexuality, in Africa and other parts of the world, and in their fight for greater legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. The struggle for equality and justice is ongoing, but with persistence and solidarity, we can create a brighter future for all members of the LGBTQ+ community.

Migrants' Rights Network,Shamima Begum: Our Statement,22-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/22/shamima-begum-our-statement/,"The news that Shamima Begum has lost her legal challenge over the decision to deprive her of British citizenship is incredibly alarming. It sets a worrying precedent in the UK, particularly for Muslim and racialised communities. It suggests ‘Britishness’ can be called into question and revoked, leaving a person stateless and without fundamental rights. Deprivation of citizenship without notice, as set out in the Nationality and Borders Act, reaffirms the concept of who is welcome in the UK and who is a threat. Since 2010, the majority of those who have been stripped of British citizenship are Muslims with South Asian, Middle Eastern or North African heritage. Shamima Begum has been characterised as the archetype of that threat despite being a victim. If we are to challenge these discriminatory immigration and security policies then we have to continue to raise awareness of divisive ideology aimed at marginalised and racialised communities in the UK. We must stand in solidarity with Muslim communities and all those affected by this law. Image: Al-Hawl Refugee Camp, Syria, where Shamima has been living. Achilleas Zavallis/Guardian/The Guardian"
Migrants' Rights Network,Letter to HMRC and the Home Office on alleged tax discrepancies: Nadhim Zahawi and migrants,22-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/22/tax-discrepancies-letter-to-hmrc-and-home-office/,"On 22 February 2023, we wrote to HMRC and the Home Office on behalf of a group of migrants regarding the differential treatment of public servants like Nadhim Zahawi MP and migrants in relation to alleged tax discrepancies. For the last few years, we have been working with the Highly Skilled Migrants Group and Tier 1 visa holders who have been denied indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK by the Home Office on the basis of historical self-employment ‘tax discrepancies’. Clause 322(5) was used to determine that the individuals in question were ‘undesirable’ to settle in the UK on the basis of their ‘character’ and ‘dishonesty’. The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of their conduct (individual convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322 (1C), character or associations or the fact that they represent a threat to national security. In 2019, the Migrants’ Rights Network successfully intervened on behalf of the Highly Skilled Migrants Group and Tier 1 visa holders. The judgement stated that the Secretary of State at the time believed that the discrepancies were the result of deliberate misrepresentation to either HMRC or the Home Office. However, the Tier 1 visa holders stated that the errors were the result of “carelessness” or “ignorance”, not dishonesty. Prior to the dismissal of Mr Zahawi from the Cabinet, HMRC concluded that he was “careless” rather than “deliberate” in relation to his taxes. We believe that the differential treatment of Mr Zahawi in comparison to T1GMs demonstrates a significant contradiction that is of interest to the public. If Mr Zahawi has been acquitted, then we ask why migrants are being penalised. There cannot be one rule for the wealthy and one rule for migrants. MRN-Letter-to-HMRC-Feb-2023 Download"

Queerness and Migration: About this event At the Migrants’ Rights Network, we look at migration and displacement through an intersectional lens. We analyse and raise awareness of how identity impacts policy decisions towards specific groups. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent treatment of Ukrainian refugees in comparison to Afghan, Syrian or Sudanese raised questions about who is welcome in Europe and the UK. As part of our ongoing Who is Welcome event series, we want to examine specifically how border regimes impact queer people seeking safety or a better life. We discussed the unique barriers in the immigration system for queer people whilst also countering narratives of homonationalism. People from certain countries or certain religions are characterised by the media or politicians as homophobic. LGBTQ+ rights are used as a way to exclude or alienate certain groups of migrants. But migratised and racialised communities have always been at the forefront of queer resistance to oppression.

Migrants' Rights Network,Cypriot Queerness Beyond Sexuality,15-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/15/cypriot-queerness-beyond-sexuality/,"LGBT histories I am a queer second generation Cypriot migrant to the UK. For a long time, I believed that Cypriot queer history did not and could not exist. However, there are actually extensive queer Cypriot histories that I believe have been- for the most part- deliberately buried. From transgender Aphrodites, Ishtars and priestesses to the intersex figurines of the Lady of Lemba and Idol of Pomos; from Androniki’s masculine gender-expression and the public lamentation of her death to Ottoman reforms allowing private same-sex relationships; from Marika and Panagiota Hadjiyianni to Neo-Babylonian cross-dressers, Cypriot history is filled with gender and sexual subversion. We know that the erasure of these queer histories are a result of the British attempts to whitewash, civilise and Hellenize Cypriots and their identities. What does it mean to ‘queer’ migration? Migration is the movement of people across internationally recognised borders. That’s the standard definition anyway. But if we look at migration through the lens of queerness, we can reveal histories of movement not only across internationally recognised borders, but beyond them. We can honour histories of internal displacement in Cyprus, from 1960-1974, and understand them to be just as tragic and deadly as the movement across internationally recognised frontiers. As a migrant and a queer person, I exist in a doubly queer state, because the Western concept of the nation-state was never meant to include me, on account of my migration status, but also on account of my sexuality. As a diasporic Cypriot, I will always be Cypriot-adjacent. I will never feel quite Cypriot enough, no matter how hard I try. As migrants, our histories are queered because they are broken and disrupted by movement. Yet this distance from my motherland allows me privileges. I am not surrounded by checkpoints nor by the echoes of death and destruction. Queer histories beyond LGBT Cypriot history is also queer and subversive, but in ways that extend beyond the parameters of gender and sexuality. Most people today are aware of and conceptualise Cypriots as two distinct groups: Greek and Turkish. Yet these two ethnic identities were imposed on Cypriots by British colonial policies and attitudes, in order to turn them against each other as per typical divide and rule fashion. These imagined identity constructs were created with the sole purpose of fomenting conflict, in order to legitimise Britain’s colonial role as protector, peacekeeper and guarantor in a conflict that the British empire itself facilitated. Before British colonialism, working class Turkish-speaking Cypriots (TSC) and Greek-speaking Cypriots (GSC) participated in multi-communal revolts against a corrupt Orthodox Church and Ottoman administration. TSCs and GSCs saw themselves as Christians and Muslims, not as Greeks or Turks. They lived together in mixed villages, in ‘symbiosis’. This is a history that is frequently left out of any kind of mainstream educational syllabus. No mention of this multi-communal and unapologetically Cypriot history was made in any of the years I attended Greek school. For British TSCs attending Turkish schools, I imagine the situation was quite the same. The mainstream education that diaspora Cypriots receive mirrors the education provided in the ROC and TRNC. These mainland ethno-nationalisms (Greek and Turkish) are the dominant discourse underpinning Cyprus and Cypriot identity. However, our multi communal histories survive and haunt the present, despite a deliberate distortion of the past. The Cypriotist position draws on our multi communal histories in order to disseminate a vision of Cypriotness free from these colonial labels of Greek and Turk, and to reassert Cypriot as a valid identity. The Cypriotist position is actually a queer one, since it is defiant of colonial legacies. Queerness is not merely a reference to one’s non-cis or non-hetero gender or sexuality: it can be, and always was, so much more than that. Queerness is a resistive orientation, a commitment to hopeful worldmaking. It involves an intense dissatisfaction with the world as it is, and a restless desire for it to be different. In this restlessness, we can locate queerness. Queerness is about reclaiming deviance and nonconformity, and it is a rejection of the structures that kill us. Queerness is defiant of racial capitalism, imperialism, colonial logic, and all other structures of oppression that fortify our “post”-colonial bordered world. by Anastasia Gavalas for #LGBTHistoryMonth References: @cypriotess_in_distress, “A short history of sexuality and gender expression in Cyprus” (Instagram, June 2022).

Migrants' Rights Network,‘Inclusion’ celebrates who we are,02-Feb-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/02/02/inclusion-celebrates-who-we-are/,"‘Inclusion’ means your culture, identity and experience are accepted and valued. ‘Integration’ forces us to lose our identities. I have been in the UK since 1997. I’ve buried a lot from those early days but my experiences have shaped how I feel about the concept of integration. When I first arrived in the late 90’s, there was no restriction on the ability to work for asylum seekers. I began working in market research. My job was to work on buses and ask people questions, largely in predominantly White areas like Dagenham. The way people treated me had a huge impact on me. They made very quick assumptions about the way I looked and my accent. They asked questions like “You don’t belong here”, or “Can I see your passport?”. They didn’t accept me because they saw me as different. The emphasis on ‘integrating’ means we are expected to be part of the wider majority and forces us to lose our individual identities if they’re seen to be different. I left the job in market research when I started training to become a teacher. It was here I realised the power of replacing ‘integration’ with ‘inclusion’. Inclusion means your culture, identity and experience are accepted and valued. As a teacher, I saw the emphasis on the word ‘inclusion’ to support everyone, from those who perhaps had learning difficulties to those for whom English was not their first language, to be successful and thrive. I wish I could say I felt our attitudes had changed over 26 years, but they haven’t. Although in education I think the idea of inclusion is welcomed, the concept of integration continues to be promoted by the Home Office. People arriving in the UK are still expected to shed who they are and subscribe to the wider ‘British’ society. We are not invaders The idea of invasion has been around for a long time. I was grappling with it before Suella Braverman stood up in the House of Commons and made that horrible statement about people invading our country via the Channel. Asylum seekers have been seen as ‘invaders’ who are ‘milking the system’ for a long time. And we’ve been treated with suspicion as a result. I had been in the UK for just three months when I was stopped and searched by plain-clothed officers. It was January 1998 and it was bitterly cold. I was being supported by Hammersmith and Fulham social services at the time and they had given me a large puffer jacket with lots of pockets to wear. I was walking when three men rounded me up because they thought I looked suspicious. It was so scary and I tried to run in my state of shock. They told me that they thought I looked “like a drug dealer” in this large coat and that the only reason I could possibly have so many pockets is because I was keeping drugs in them. My English wasn’t as good back then, so when they found a £30 food voucher that social services had given me, they called up social services to check who I was. This had a profound impact on me for a long time. But despite all the negative things that shaped my early life in the UK, I have positive memories that helped me build my life here. When I was supported by social services, there was a big picture of Albert Einstein in the office. Underneath were the words “Einstein was a refugee”. That stayed with me because it made me feel that it is possible to be both a refugee and successful. – Written by a member of the MRN community This blog post is part of our Words Matter x NSW series ."
Migrants' Rights Network,The burden of explaining where you are from,28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/the-burden-of-explaining/,"The burden of explaining where you are from can be exhausting, especially if there is a complicated story behind it. “Where are you from?” I have a very complicated relationship with this question. Ultimately, my feelings on the phrase depend on the given context. I appreciate that the power dynamics of this line of questioning can be skewed.  If the conversation is between a non-migratised White person and a Person of Colour, the power dynamics can be incredibly problematic and one-sided. Sometimes when I have been asked this question, it has been asked in the format of “are you from Iran?” or “are you North African?” In some ways, I find this experience validating as an individual from the SWANA region, especially since I have often questioned whether I truly belong in this region because of a whitewashing of my history. However, this is a very unique sense of affirmation that only people from the Cypriot community may experience, especially after doubting the identities we have been fed our entire lives. The burden However, this question is also a double-edged sword for me. Even before I had questioned what I had been told about my identity, this questions would still create a jarring or uncomfortable aftereffect: “Where are you from?” “I’m Greek”. “Where in Greece are you from?” “Well I’m actually from Cyprus”. Now that I identify as Cypriot, this question becomes even more uncomfortable: “Where are you from?” “I’m from Cyprus. I am Cypriot”. “The Greek or Turkish side?” When I am asked this, I usually just respond with “the South”, simply because I do not have energy to explain that Cyprus is Cypriot, and that Greek and Turkish are identity labels imposed onto us by British colonisers. In that moment, I also don’t know if people want a history lesson. Do they want a simple answer, or the truth? I wish in these moments I could share the truth, but sometimes the burden is just too exhausting or uncomfortable, especially if the truth is provocative and shatters every single preconceived notion that the other person may hold about my community.

Migrants' Rights Network,Migration discourse is founded on colonial lies,28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/migration-discourse-colonial-lies/,"Contemporary migration discourse shows us that we don’t really live in a “post”colonial world. “Civility” Notions of “civility” are a colonial lie. When the West ignores the plight of Palestinian or Afghan refugees, in favour of those who they deem civilised (White Ukrainians), it conveniently forgets its violent and emphatically uncivilised role in creating these “fractured presents”. The British facilitated the creation of Israel and the ongoing Nakba, leading to the mass expulsion and genocide of Palestinians. Meanwhile, the CIA covertly funded the mujahideen, an armed militia group which later morphed into the Taliban. Beyond being a re-writing of history, narratives of “civility” also hurt. As someone from the Global South whose community was colonised, I recognise contemporary “civility” narratives as an extension of the colonial period: colonisers frequently used the idea that it was necessary to “civilise” and “enlighten” indigenous communities as a means of justifying their colonisation. In fact, I believe that the notion of migrants having to be “hardworking” in order to be respected is a direct attempt to counteract the coloniser viewing colonised populations as inherently “lazy”, a narrative which was also used to justify and maintain colonial conquest. Migration discourse: “Invasion” These reflections have led me to further understand how much of contemporary migratory discourse is predicated upon colonial lies. Migrants are often scapegoated by being erroneously referred to as an “invasion”, and the movement of people across borders and into the UK is weaponised to feed into a media frenzy of outrage and paranoia. However, “when my country was turned into refugees as a result of British colonialism and a decades-long plot by NATO powers for Turkey to invade, no one cared”. My country, Cyprus, is still occupied and divided to this day. So much of our population is internally displaced, and so many people hold onto their keys in the hope that one day they will be able to return to their home. It hurts to see people up in arms about border-crossings, especially when their privilege allows them to remain ignorant as to actual invasions, occupations and colonisations: events that actually are responsible for much of the migration we see today. For instance, many Cypriots moved to the UK during the 50s, when Cyprus was still a British colony. The movement continued in the 60s, during the troubling, British-backed rise of Greek and Turkish ethno-nationalisms, and continued as a result of the 1974 Turkish invasion. Migratory movement is the undoubtable symptom of British colonial legacies. Let’s start treating it as such.

Migrants' Rights Network,A story about Akrotiri + Dhekelia,28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/a-story-akrotiri-dhekelia/,"In this blog post, I share a story about the language of “expat”. In 2021, I was in my homeland, Cyprus, enjoying a night out with a friend in Agia Napa. We suddenly came across a group of White British friends, sporting t-shirts with a wide variety of slogans: “Short Lives Matter” and “Brexit Means Brexit”, among others. Given the fact that this group got their kicks out of mocking marginalised identities (they were trivialising anti-Blackness by poking fun at BLM), it was almost certain to me that they were actually avid Brexiteers, and therefore bought into the xenophobia and racism at the heart of the Brexit debate. I remember thinking to myself, “If you hate migrants so much, why did you come to Cyprus? If you hate migrants so much, why have you come to a country where so much of the population is internally displaced?” I started to think more about the aggressive presence of English people in Cyprus, whether as tourists or “expats”: British tourists who mock migrants, and by extension mock Cypriots (since a vast proportion of our community is actually diasporic or refugees), and British “expats” who settle in Cyprus, shielded by their privileged ignorance of what the UK did to Cyprus all those years ago. It’s likely that many of these tourists will later go on to settle in Cyprus when they retire, and therefore adopt the moniker of “expat”. The word “expat” troubles me. Lots of White British people who go to live in Cyprus are referred to as “expats”, yet my community is viewed as a migrant community here in the UK. As a majority POC and migrant-led organisation, MRN uses the term “migrant” in a reclamatory sense, yet we recognise that to be subjected to the label of “migrant” by the majority of Western society, is to be demonised. Why are White British people afforded the privilege of being able to move without being demonised for it? There are many White British “expats” in Cyprus, but there are also many White Brits who live in Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which are areas of Cyprus that are legally part of Britain’s Overseas Territories. These Overseas Territories are actually military bases, which are used to launch missile attacks and sustain invasions in the rest of the SWANA region. This forces Cyprus into complicity with imperialist actions. Once more, language is shown to reveal and conceal. It reveals how we, as SWANA folk, are truly seen, and it conceals and sanitises histories and legacies of invasive, colonial violence.

Migrants' Rights Network,"There are layers to our struggle, and they are all interconnected",28-Jan-23,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2023/01/28/layers-to-our-struggle/,"There are layers to the migrant experience. Integration v inclusion As a first generation Japanese migrant, I don’t like the word “integration”. It is forceful, and makes me feel like I should be like people who grow up here. But I have my own experiences, and I shouldn’t have to forget who I am in order to be respected and to be allowed to stay here. I also want my children to be proud of their Japanese heritage, and I don’t want them to feel like they have to pretend to be something they are not. I have two children, aged four and two. I encourage my children to speak Japanese. My daughter’s school also respects the fact that she is learning Japanese at home, alongside English at school, and supports her with that. My daughter also loves developing her Japanese identity and she loves the culture. The Japanese community in the UK is not particularly large, but we have a group of friends who have young children, and so our families spend time together on the weekends. My daughter has Russian and Turkish friends, but also has lots of Japanese friends that she enjoys playing with.She is always excited to see her grandparents and cousins in Japan. I am more comfortable with the term “inclusion” instead, as it shows respect for and celebration of our differences. Fortunately I have not felt any negative experiences as a migrant in the UK. Migrant ‘assimilation’ in Japan My husband’s story is different from mine. He moved from China to Japan when he was eight years old, and until moving to the UK, he mainly lived in Japan. He is fluent in Japanese and is very familiar with Japanese culture. Growing up in Japan, he was treated negatively because he was a migrant, including by teachers, and he even had to change schools due to these experiences, because he felt he wasn’t being taken care of as much as the Japanese students were. He felt pressure to assimilate, to be “more Japanese” instead of Chinese. It was difficult for him to navigate his identity. Was he Japanese? Was he Chinese? Where was his home? He wanted to leave Japan because of this, and move to the UK. It seems like Japan expects or enforces the assimilation of migrants more than the UK does. He feels more comfortable in the UK, as he feels less pressure to assimilate. Especially in London where there are lots of migrant communities. Because I have a stronger sense of home than my husband, I felt more comfortable in Japan than I do in the UK. I think this is because he’s experienced  being a migrant from a young age. He has experienced more than one “home” whereas my story of being a migrant started in my adult years, and I am still adjusting to building a “home away from home”. When I learnt about my husband’s story, I was shocked. Growing up, I knew that there were big Chinese and South Korean communities in Japan, but since all my close friends were Japanese, I grew up in a non-diversified, monocultural bubble. I didn’t realise that first and second generation migrants often have negative experiences in Japan. After hearing his story, and the story of his family, I realised how closed Japanese society was. I believe that Japanese society should become open and welcoming to migrants who chose to make Japan their home. I now know that Japanese politicians and the government in general refuse to recognise the humanity and dignity of migrants, calling them “foreigners” instead of migrants. I find this word to be exclusionary and dehumanising: because the word “foreigner” is difficult to define, it can be used to exclude many people, which is dangerous. Who defines the word “foreigner” and how? Human rights violations against asylum seekers are common in Japan’s immigration detention centres. They are like prisons. The Japanese media does not try to reveal or uncover the truth , and this makes me so angry. Clearly there is a long way to go. In some ways, the situation in Japan is comparable to the situation here, or sometimes is even worse. There are layers to our struggles, and they are all interconnected I also have complicated feelings towards the term “hardworking”. It is clear that the UK’s points-based immigration system prioritises migrants who can financially “contribute” to the British economy. My visa status makes me feel uncertain and less confident, since I am a dependent of my husband, which means my status in the UK is entirely tied to his. Sometimes, this makes me feel like I am not worthy of being here. I feel like I continuously have to prove myself, and I have never felt this kind of pressure before. In Japan, I felt independent, and nobody assessed my capabilities, knowledge and experiences. I now feel like I have less ownership and power over my life. In Japan, I could do anything. Here, I cannot. I have never shared my migration experience before publicly. Sometimes I feel like it is not appropriate for me to complain about my situation, because there are people who have it worse. I am aware that my visa status affords me with certain privileges that asylum seekers and refugees do not have. I can work and study here, and can open a bank account, and I do not constantly fear deportation. I share my story not to compare or dismiss the struggles of asylum seekers, but because I believe it is important to understand the nuances of being a migrant. Migrants all have different experiences depending on their different statuses. There are layers to our struggles, and they are all interconnected.

Migrants' Rights Network,Albania: MRN + JCWI Joint Statement,15-Dec-22,https://migrantsrights.org.uk/2022/12/15/albania-joint-statement/,"Amongst the many inhumane measures he announced, we are particularly troubled by the Government’s harmful rhetoric and for singling out people from Albania. We urge the Government to stop plans to “fast-track” Albanian asylum claims and deport people to Albania based on unfounded assertions that it is a so-called “safe country”. We know from the people we work in solidarity with that many claiming asylum in the UK from Albania are survivors of trafficking and modern slavery, and that any fast-tracked deportation scheme would place them at risk of re-trafficking and further harm. The Home Office’s own recent statistics also show that the majority of asylum claims made by people from Albania are granted. It is incredibly upsetting to see cross-party support for rollbacks of protections particularly around modern slavery claims. We categorically stand against plans to raise the modern slavery threshold which have the potential to put thousands at risk and keep them in exploitative conditions. This Government and their friends in the are fuelling division and hatred in order to score political points, with complete disregard for the lives, families and communities devastated by such brutal laws and policies. What we need are more and functioning safe routes for people to come to the UK, to seek refuge, to be reunited with their loved ones, and to rebuild their lives, as well as better – not weakened – protections for survivors of trafficking and modern slavery. We need to radically transform this hostile, racist system into one centred around compassion, dignity and humanity. In search of this, we stand in solidarity with Albanians and all those seeking safety and a new life. Statement by MRN + JCWI"
Freedom from Torture,Supreme Court rules plan to send refugees to Rwanda ‘unlawful’,15-Nov-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/supreme-court-rules-refugees-rwanda-unlawful,"In a victory for human rights and compassion, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Government's plan to send refugees to Rwanda is unlawful. Freedom from Torture is delighted that the Supreme Court has affirmed what caring people already knew: the UK Government’s ‘cash for humans’ deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, but it also flies in the face of the laws of this country. The stakes of this case could not have been higher. Every day in our therapy rooms we see the terror that this scheme has inflicted on survivors of torture who have come to the UK seeking sanctuary. Instead of devising inhumane policies that defy our legal and moral duties, the Government should focus on clearing the enormous asylum backlog, in which thousands of torture survivors are languishing, unable to recover or rebuild their lives. Now more than ever, we must continue to stand united against the Government’s cruel and punitive anti-refugee policies and demand an asylum system that treats people with humanity, dignity and compassion."
Freedom from Torture,Freedom from Torture’s statement on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories,10-Nov-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/freedom-from-tortures-statement-on-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories,"Freedom from Torture is horrified at the atrocities in Gaza and Israel including mounting reports of torture by all parties since the latest hostilities commenced on 7 October. We stand in solidarity with all people grieving for loved ones, with survivors of this appalling violence, and all those affected here in the UK and around the world. We are appalled that one month on, hostages remain in captivity and that evidence of war crimes, including collective punishment, continues to grow. For more than 35 years, Freedom from Torture has borne witness to the physical and mental scars of torture and helped many thousands of survivors to rebuild their lives. We recognise and deplore the long-standing systematic use of torture by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities. There is no justification for torture. Not in retaliation, not in war, not in any circumstances. Torture destroys lives and it is never, ever permitted. There are no exceptions. Those who torture must be held accountable for their actions – always. All States have a responsibility to prevent torture, whether committed under their own authority or by others. It is imperative that when responding to these hostilities and the wider context of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the UK government upholds the rules-based international system. The principle of universality of human rights is the foundation for all human rights, including the right to be free from torture, on which all of our work as an anti-torture organisation is based. The UK government must immediately and publicly condemn violations and abuses on all sides. We call on the UK government to bring its influence to bear to ensure all parties to the conflict comply with international humanitarian and human rights laws, including the absolute prohibition of torture in all circumstances. Furthermore, the UK government should refrain from any actions or statements that could risk being interpreted as a green light for international crimes including torture. As it has done for other conflicts, the UK should work with the international community to ensure that perpetrators of serious international crimes, including torture, are brought to justice in line with international standards. Many survivors of torture with whom we work are only alive today because armed conflicts in which they were caught up were brought to a halt. The UK government should work to ensure the commitment by all sides to an effective, unconditional and immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages. In an effort to avert the ever deepening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, the government must further ensure there is safe and sustained humanitarian access for all necessary medical staff and supplies. Finally, we know from our decades of therapeutic work with survivors of torture from conflicts across the world that a durable political solution must address the complex collective inter-generational traumas across communities. We urge the UK and the wider global community to take account of this in the important peace-building work to come."
Freedom from Torture,Bibby Stockholm: Why refugees and torture survivors shouldn’t be housed on floating prisons,21-Aug-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/bibby-stockholm-not-suitable-refugees-and-torture-survivors,"In recent months the Government has been the centre of controversy with its focus on the Bibby Stockholm, a floating barge that resembles a prison and is designed to house refugees. But accommodation schemes like barges and tents pitched on abandoned military bases are cruel and simply not fit for purpose. The Bibby Stockholm, which has been branded a ‘potential death trap’ by fire services and contained traces of potentially deadly Legionella, is far from the ‘perfectly decent accommodation’ one Minister described it as. In fact, there’s been lots of misunderstanding about how suitable accommodation like barges are for people fleeing danger and persecution. So here are four reasons why refugees and torture survivors should not be housed on floating prisons ."
Freedom from Torture,My heart aches for young women imprisoned and suffering in Iran today,08-Aug-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/30-years-ago-iran-regime-tried-to-silence-me,"Nasrin Parvaz, member of Survivors Speak OUT , writes about how the regime is using torture and imprisonment to respond to protests in Iran. In the 1980s I was imprisoned in Iran for eight years just for taking to the streets and fighting for my freedom and demanding liberty. The regime tried to silence me with torture and threats of sexual violence. My heart aches for the young women who are still being subjected to the same kind of torture that I was more than thirty years ago. On 15th March 2023, Sepideh Qolyian , one of Iran’s most prominent female activists, was re-arrested only a few hours after being released. She had already spent five years in prison. Sepideh was imprisoned in Evin Prison, one of the primary site for housing Iran’s political prisoners since 1972, kept in solitary confinement in wing 209 and threatened with rape by the prison guards . Thirty-five years ago, I was held in the very same wing, and it was used as a torture chamber. Prisoners then, just like now, were threatened with rape, and were physically and mentally abused. Some of my fellow prisoners hanged themselves with their chadors because they just couldn’t go on anymore. A chador covers the whole body except the face, and it was compulsory to wear when I was imprisoned. The regime’s excuse for the hijab law is that women should be covered. But we, Iranian women, know that we are just mere scapegoats being used to suppress an entire country. The regime has recently ramped up its use of systemic torture to frighten and silence activists since the death of 22-year-old Zhina Mahasa Amini at the hands of Iran’s abusive “morality police” in September 2022."
Freedom from Torture,Sunak’s heartless proposal to force refugees to live on barges is a mental and physical health catastrophe waiting to happen,27-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/forcing-refugees-barges-catastrophe-health,"For survivors of torture, living on overcrowded barges like the Bibby Stockholm can have a devastating effect. In this blog, Ann Salter (Clinical Services Manager North West ) makes a case for providing adequate accommodation for refugees. Almost all of the hundreds of traumatised people I have treated have endured horrific journeys across water to reach safety, whether that’s the English Channel, the Aegean Sea or the Mediterranean Sea. These crossings are almost always traumatic – the vessels aren’t seaworthy, those on board typically can’t swim, or there aren’t enough lifejackets. People who’ve made these crossings may also have seen fellow travellers drown. But now, Rishi Sunak’s heartless and unworkable proposal will see refugees, including survivors of torture, crammed onto floating detention centres on the sea. For many of these people, being on the water will inevitably lead to re-traumatisation. I can state without a doubt that the use of barges as sites to house refugees who have fled war and torture is totally inappropriate. Conditions are bound to be cramped and overcrowded and may be reminiscent of the places of detention in which they were tortured, which can lead to re-triggering of the trauma. Every day we speak to survivors in our therapy rooms who describe the horror, isolation and hopelessness that they feel from being housed in these kinds of dangerous accommodations. I can’t stress enough how this is a mental and physical health catastrophe waiting to happen. At Freedom from Torture, we help survivors who are experiencing the debilitating symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to develop coping strategies to help manage their symptoms. Survivors and refugees who have experience of flashbacks talk of how just being able to go outside is vital in supporting their mental health and recovery. We know that being part of a local community or being able to attend services at churches or mosques, go to English lessons, and access therapy services like ours, are essential. People can recover from their trauma and cope with their symptoms by having agency over their own lives, things like just being able to leave the house whenever they want. Something that we all take for granted every single day will not be freely available to the people housed on these barges."
Freedom from Torture,'Illegal Migration' Act - Everything you need to know,18-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/illegal-migration-act-everything-you-need-to-know,"The Refugee Ban Bill – officially known as the ‘Illegal Migration Bill’ – is the Government’s latest inhumane and cruel attempt to strip away the basic rights of torture survivors and refugees. Read below for everything you need to know about the new law. What is the Illegal Migration Bill? The Refugee Ban Bill was announced by the Government on 7 March 2023, before becoming an Act on 20 July 2023. It's the latest piece of legislation targeting the rights of refugees and torture survivors. It effectively bans the right to seek asylum in the UK. The purpose of the Bill is to deter refugees from seeking safety in the UK . It does this by punishing people who take ‘irregular’ journeys to the UK, such as arriving via small boat, stowing away in a lorry, or flying into the UK without a legitimate visa. It places a duty on the Home Secretary to oversee the removal of anyone who enters the UK outside of normal immigration laws or has travelled through a ‘safe third country’ – even if they’re fleeing persecution or torture. Most people seeking asylum have little choice but to take dangerous journeys and don’t have the option to use the Government’s so-called ‘safe and legal routes’. Internationally, less than 1% of the world’s refugees can access resettlement schemes run by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). No refugee visa exists for people who need to quickly leave their country and airlines get fined if they allow refugees to travel to the UK without valid visas. Historically, when a country becomes unsafe and begins to produce refugees, the UK will start denying those nationals visas that would allow people to access planes and arrive in the UK quickly and safely as a means of seeking safety (applying for asylum) – this happened at the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2015. Much of the Refugee Ban Bill – which the Archbishop of Canterbury described as ‘morally unacceptable and politically impractical’ – not only contradicts the UK’s commitments to international law, but it also erodes the UK’s reputation as a leader in refugee protection . At Freedom from Torture we call it the ‘Refugee Ban Bill’ simply because it’s a piece of anti-refugee legislation. It effectively extinguishes the UK’s asylum system. It is unfair, inhumane and unlawful ."
Freedom from Torture,Refugee Ban Bill will effectively extinguish the right to seek asylum in the UK,13-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/refugee-ban-bill-will-effectively-extinguish-the-right-to-seek-asylum-in-the-uk,"The law firm Leigh Day, on behalf of Freedom from Torture, has examined the proposed 'Illegal Migration Bill'. It says that the Bill will effectively extinguish the right to seek asylum in the UK. Key aspects of the Bill are incompatible with the UK’s international obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugee Convention), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the European Convention Against Trafficking (ECAT), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CRC), say Counsel instructed by law firm Leigh Day. They add that the Bill seeks to undermine long-established domestic safeguards against arbitrary detention and to significantly curtail the courts’ constitutional role as an independent check on the lawfulness of executive action. Raza Husain KC and Eleanor Mitchell of Matrix Chambers and Jason Pobjoy, George Molyneaux and Antonia Eklund of Blackstone Chambers took instruction from Leigh Day partner, Tessa Gregory and solicitor Carolin Ott, who represented Freedom from Torture in our successful challenge to the Home Office policy of turning back migrant boats in the English Channel. The 'Illegal Migration Bill' has faced staunch opposition in the House of Lords with the Lords proposing numerous important amendments including a key amendment to clause 1 of the Bill to make clear the Government intends to act compatibly with its international obligations. Whilst the Government has made some concessions including on the Bill’s retrospective application, and the retention of existing limits on the detention of unaccompanied children and pregnant women, it has sought to overturn the majority of the amendments agreed during the Lords stages of the Bill. In its current form the Bill will: Remove people who enter the UK by irregular routes to their home country, or a safe third country, such as Rwanda Remove the right to modern slavery protections Ignore human rights claims made by asylum seekers Extend powers of detention By blocking access to asylum in the UK without any guarantee that it will be made accessible elsewhere, the UK is renouncing its commitment to international refugee protection, says the legal team. These concerns were echoed in the House of Lords where the Government’s commitment to adhering to its international obligations was repeatedly questioned. The entire regime penalises unlawful arrivals and so breaches Article 31 of the Refugee Convention which protects refugees who arrive a country of refuge by unlawful means. The Bill sets a low threshold for a country to be treated as generally safe for removal and makes it extremely difficult to mount individual challenges to removal to the countries treated as generally safe. It creates a serious risk of a failure to implement Refugee Convention obligations in good faith by knowingly transferring asylum-seekers to countries which will not respect their rights under the Convention. The Bill allows removal to designated states irrespective of whether, generally or in relation to the individual, they will respect the Refugee Convention, and indeed even if it is clear that they will not do so. The Bill provides for only two types of claim to suspend or prevent removal. There is a high risk of procedural unfairness when trying to make such claims, especially because of very tight deadlines for submitting claims and appeals, which risk creating insurmountable barriers to accessing lawyers and the courts. In breach of Article 34 of the Refugee Convention, rather than making a good-faith effort to help refugees meet the requirements for citizenship, the Bill would place them in a state of limbo and impose permanent barriers to settling lawfully in the UK and becoming British citizens. Courts have made clear that leaving people in a state of immigration limbo will eventually breach Article 8 ECHR, the right to respect for private and family life. The Bill also breaches Articles 10 and 13 of the European Convention Against Trafficking (ECAT) by allowing potential victims of trafficking to be stripped of support and removed. The Bill creates serious risks of removal contrary to Article 4 ECHR and to Article 16 ECAT, which requires that victims of trafficking be returned only with “due regard for rights, safety and dignity”. It also risks breaching the UK’s duty under Article 4 ECHR to take steps to protect potential or confirmed victims from a real/present/continuing risk of re-trafficking. Further, the Bill creates a risk that victims of trafficking will be removed from the UK before they are even given an opportunity to cooperate with the authorities, thwarting the UK’s ability to identify and prosecute people traffickers. The legal team also highlight concerns about the treatment of children under the Bill. They say limitations on the powers to remove children are insufficient and the power to defer the removal of unaccompanied children is also problematic as it leaves the child in limbo, contrary to the need for continuity in the child’s upbringing under Article 20 CRC.

Freedom from Torture,Where does torture happen around the world?,12-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/where-does-torture-happen-around-the-world,"The use of torture is completely prohibited by international law. However, many countries still employ torture methods. Read our guide below to learn about the situations in countries many of our clients are coming from. What is the UN Convention Against Torture? An overwhelming majority of the world’s countries have ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, since it was first adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1984."
Freedom from Torture,What is torture?,12-Jul-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/what-is-torture,"Torture is when someone deliberately inflicts mental or physical pain on another person for a specific purpose, where the state is involved or is unable or unwilling to prevent it. Torture is still used by governments, security forces and police, and rebel or insurgent groups across the world to silence and control. Read about how torture is defined, where torture happens around the world, why people are still being tortured, and how we work with torture survivors to rebuild their lives. How is torture defined? The definition of torture put forward by the United Nations Convention against Torture (UNCAT) is the internationally agreed definition of torture. UNCAT is the key international human rights treaty that prohibits torture under any circumstances. As of June 2023, 173 States have agreed to be legally bound by the obligations of the treaty. However, because torture is absolutely prohibited under customary international law, all States across the world are obligated to protect people under their jurisdiction from torture regardless of whether they have signed up to UNCAT. Torture is defined by UNCAT as any act where severe physical or mental pain and suffering is intentionally inflicted: to obtain information or a confession from someone as punishment for something someone has done or is suspected to have done to intimidate or coerce someone for reasons based on discrimination. According to the UNCAT definition of torture, these acts are carried out by a public official/s or a person, or people, acting in an official capacity, or with their knowledge and acceptance. This does not necessarily mean that torture is only recognised or acknowledged when it is carried out by State actors, or a person, people or group acting with the State. For example, the European Court of Human Rights says that States have a responsibility not only to not torture people under their jurisdiction, but also to protect them from torture by State and non-state, or private actors."
Freedom from Torture,Plan to send refugees to Rwanda ‘unlawful’ – A vital win as the Court of Appeal rules on the Government’s plan,29-Jun-23,https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/plan-to-send-refugees-to-rwanda-unlawful,"In a huge win for human rights and compassion, today the Court of Appeal ruled that the Government’s plan to send refugees to Rwanda is unlawful. We are delighted that the appeal verdict has affirmed what the caring people of this country already knew: the UK Government’s ‘cash for humans’ deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, it flies in the face of the laws of this country. Freedom from Torture provided evidence and expertise to the Court demonstrating that survivors of torture will struggle to disclose their harrowing experiences in a process that moves at breakneck speed – and with few safeguards to ensure they can challenge their removal. As the Government makes plans for its next steps, with the possibility of taking the case to the Supreme Court, we will continue to campaign for a UK that welcomes refugees and supports survivors of torture in their healing journey. We've already shown that people power works. Now, with so many depending on us, it's time to win again. With the Refugee Ban Bill still passing through parliament, we need to keep up the fight. That’s why we’re asking you to write to your MP and call on them to oppose this cruel Bill. Sonya Sceats, Chief Executive of Freedom from Torture, said: “Every day in Freedom from Torture’s therapy rooms, torture survivors confide in our clinicians their fears this expulsion scheme has generated amongst people seeking safety in this country. As we outlined in our intervention in the Court of Appeal, this dirty deal with Rwanda does too little to identify and protect survivors and other vulnerable groups and would see them placed at risk of further harm. “Sunak’s inhumane policy has sparked anger across the UK, from protesters on the streets to faith leaders and cultural icons. If he is serious about offering sanctuary to those most in need, he should focus on rebuilding a fair and compassionate asylum system, one that welcomes and offers a fair hearing to refugees no matter how they arrive.”"

As well as winning the top prize in the Campaigning & Advocacy category, Freedom from Torture was chosen as the Overall Winner by this year’s judges for our creative and successful campaign to stop airlines from flying refugees to Rwanda as part of the government’s new anti-refugee agenda. The Stop the Flights campaign focused on the UK government’s plans to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda to process asylum claims. Horrified by this announcement in April 2022 – especially as survivors of torture were among those being threatened with removal – Freedom from Torture formulated a campaign that specifically targeted the six airlines that were shortlisted for the flight contracts, transporting refugees to Rwanda. Torture survivors contributed directly to the design and implementation of the campaign, and many signed up for a campaign leadership programme, learning the components of organising and campaign strategy. The awards are helping send a clear message: Not in our name. Can you help us keep up the fight against the government's cruel plans, continue championing a fairer asylum system, and provide therapy, financial assistance and ongoing support to survivors?"

We are thrilled that Adjoa Andoh, star of the hit Netflix drama Bridgerton and supporter of our work, will appear in our appeal to raise funds for survivors of torture across the UK. You can tune in to listen to our appeal at 07:54 am and 21:25pm on Sunday 5th March and at 15:27pm on the following Thursday 9th March . Hear from Adjoa directly on why you should consider supporting our work: In our appeal, Adjoa describes the story of Nasrin Parvaz, who was jailed by the Iranian regime for campaigning for better human rights. Nasrin was tortured so badly while in prison that she was temporarily paralysed and developed a brain tumour. After fleeing to the UK severely traumatised, she received therapy from Freedom from Torture and has since been able to continue her activism, while forging a successful career as an author, artist and public speaker.

Rainbow Migration,Stop the Rwanda Bill!,11-Dec-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/stop-the-rwanda-bill/,"Despite being found unlawful by the Supreme Court, this government still wants to go ahead with its plan to send people seeking safety here more than 4,000 miles away. The new Rwanda Bill is dangerous and disgraceful and cannot be passed by Parliament. Email your MP to call on them to vote against this cruel Bill. We all want to live in a society where everyone is treated with care and respect. But this government is trying to divide us in an attempt to weaken our rights and freedoms and prevent us from holding them accountable for their actions. Its Rwanda Bill will strip human rights away from people who come to the UK in the hope of safety for them and their loved ones. If this bill goes ahead, LGBTQI+ people who come to the UK seeking protection could also be sent to Rwanda.We have repeatedly warnedthat Rwanda is a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. TheUK government’s own websitestates that LGBT people in Rwanda are abused, including by local authorities. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that people have sought asylum in the UK based on their sexual orientation. People who arrive in the UK seeking asylum have fled persecution or conflict, and sending them 4,000 miles away to a place where they have no connections will only cause them further suffering. As Innocent, a gay man who grew up in Rwanda and experienced first-hand abuse, said: “The UK government should reflect more on its policy, hear out and take into account the public sentiment and what the civil society and other people representing vulnerable groups are saying. Most people seeking protection are fleeing for their lives and they need help, not punishment. I do hope that LGBTQIA+ people seeking safety will not be sent to Rwanda to face discrimination.” We will not be divided. Email your MP today to stop the Rwanda Bill.

Rainbow Migration,“I will have to hide my identity in my own room”,01-Dec-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/i-will-have-to-hide-my-identity-in-my-own-room/,"LGBTQI+ people come to the UK fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries and hoping to rebuild their lives in safety here. However, this government continues to place them in inappropriate and unsafe shared asylum accommodationwhile they wait for months or even years for an asylum decision. In shared accommodation, LGBTQI+ people are often subject to abuse and mistreatment, which can further traumatise people who are seeking safety and protection. We have documented many concerns about room-sharing for LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. In our experience, sharing a bedroom can be particularly dangerous for LGBTQI+ people. We have sadly received distressed calls from our service users, reporting incidents of abuse and harassment in shared rooms. A trans man who had been attacked back home, was placed in shared accommodation where he woke up to find some of the men he was sharing the space with were stripping off his clothes.As reported in The Guardian, he said: “The hotel staff blocked my room card [because I refused to stay in the room, but] they said I had to share. I could not do it. I slept outside the room on the stairs and cried all night. It was the worst night of my life since I arrived in the UK.” Eventually he was put on a single room. Another lesbian that we support, told the Guardian she had been forced to sign a document agreeing to room share and was terrified of what might happen to her. She said: “I will have to hide my identity in my own room. So many of us are dealing with mental health issues and trying to overcome trauma but the letter I signed said I do not have the right to object to room sharing.” This government should ensure LGBTQI+ people are accommodated suitably and safeguarded from harm while they seek to rebuild their lives in safety here.

The Rwanda plan was always cruel and immoral. We urge the Government to immediately abandon such plans with Rwanda or with any other country, and instead protect the rights of people who have come to our country in search of sanctuary. While we welcome the decision today, we remain concerned by this Government’s overall treatment of people who move to this country. We are alarmed by this Government’s continuous efforts to detain and forcibly send people to countries where they may not know anyone, especially if it puts them at risk of harm and human rights violations. We know that as a community we are compassionate and welcoming, and we need immigration policies that are rooted in that same care, compassion, and respect for human rights. We call on everyone to stand up for the rights of people seeking sanctuary, regardless of where they come from or how they travel here.

Rainbow Migration,Joint Statement: LGBTQI+ people seeking safety here will not be sent to Rwanda,15-Nov-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/joint-statement-lgbtqi-people-seeking-safety-here-will-not-be-sent-to-rwanda/,"Joint statement: Rainbow Migration andMicro Rainbow We are ecstatic that this government’s cruel plan to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda has been found unlawful by the Supreme Court. This is a huge victory for kindness and common decency. “This is a day for national celebration. The judges at the UK’s highest court have stopped this trade in humans and many people in the UK who have fled unimaginable horrors can breathe a sigh of relief”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration. “Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s commitment to pushing ahead with the Rwanda plan risked turning the UK into a country famous for its cruel policies and attitudes towards people who need safety. We, and everyone we work with, are very happy that it has finally been found unlawful. Our beneficiaries can take a breath of relief, but they are still not safe.  Now is the time to build a humane and dignified immigration system that we can all be proud of”. Sebastian Rocca, Micro Rainbow CEO For many months since it was first announced back in April 2022, we have repeatedly warned that Rwanda is a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. The UK government’s own website states that LGBT people in Rwanda are abused, including by local authorities. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that people have sought asylum in the UK based on their sexual orientation. There iswidespread evidenceof ill-treatment and abuse faced by LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda – It’s extremely concerning that this government is willing to send LGBTQI+ people who have fled life-threatening situations in their home countries and sought safety and protection in the UK to another country where they would be in danger. Innocent Uwimana, a gay man who grew up in Rwanda and came to the UK twenty years agowroteabout his struggles back home: “Growing up, I got bullied a lot because I was gay, the bullying spilled over into violence; I was terrified of going to school. When I started secondary school, it was even worse. I was physically abused by other students because they perceived me as gay. Having experienced the discrimination faced by LGBTQI+ people, I am shocked that the UK would deport people from our community there”. Innocent alsotalked to LGBTQI+ activistsbased in Rwanda, who expressed their surprise and disbelief in hearing about the UK government’s plan: “Most LGBTQI+ people want to leave Rwanda. They want to live in a place where they can be free and themselves. So why would the UK government think it is safe to send LGBTQI+ people there?” LGBTQI+ people could still be sent to other unsafe countries This decision also means that the government has nowhere to systematically send people seeking asylum to, as this government currently has no other return agreements with other countries. However, the recently passed Illegal Migration Actlists other countrieswhere people could be sent to have their claims processed. Many of these so-called ‘safe’ countries are dangerous for LGBTQI+ people. This list includes Ghana as deemed safe for men, but in 2021 nine people from Ghana were granted refugee status in the UK based on their sexual orientation. A year ago, Adams, a bisexual man from Ghana that Rainbow Migration supported was granted asylum. He was violently attacked in the street on several occasions. When he got to the UK, he got the news that his partner had been killed back home. Last week, this government announced it wanted to addIndiato the list of countries deemed safe. However in 2022, thirteen people from India were granted asylum in the UK *based on their sexual orientation.Nisha, a trans woman from India had to escape from India after her parents locked her in the house and forced her to undergo conversion practices. The Illegal Migration Act also makes it significantly more likely that LGBTQI+ people who come here will be detained, with fewer safeguards and for a minimum of 28 days. With the announcement of a new Home Secretary, it’s time for a change of direction: We call on this government to get in line with public sentiment, to ditch their heartless asylum policies and to create a more humane and compassionate asylum system so that people can rebuild their lives in safety.    *The experimental statistics show the number of asylum claims where sexual orientation was raised as a basis, or part of the basis, of the claim Disclaimer The content of this website is provided for general information only and should not be relied on as legal advice.

Rainbow Migration,LGBTQI+ people shouldn’t be moved to a floating prison,20-Oct-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/lgbtqi-people-shouldnt-be-moved-to-a-floating-prison/,"As this governmentstarts moving people seeking protection back to a floating prisonwe say it loud and clearagain: Housing people in prison-like conditions is cruel and risks further traumatising people who have had to flee unimaginable dangers and life-threatening situations. Some of the LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum that we support have already started receiving letters confirming their move in the coming days, which is extremely concerning. We know that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are particularly at risk of harm and can face serious issues when forced to live in overcrowded conditions. People will have limited access to support and they will also not be free to move around the port, so conditions on the barge are very similar to being in prison or immigration detention. In detention, LGBTQI+ people are likely to experience discrimination and harassmentfrom other people who can hold LGBTQI-phobic views. Trans people can be at even greater risk of abuse. The people that we work with are worried about being moved to the barge, and are feeling extremely anxious about this possibility and the impact it would have on them.We ask that this government commits to housing LGBTQI+ people in suitable accommodation in the community and safeguarded from harm while they seek to rebuild their lives in safety here.

Rainbow Migration,Enough: Trans people are people too,06-Oct-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/enough-trans-people-are-people-too/,"We have come together with LGBTQI+ organisations and allies across the country to say enough! Trans people are people too. Full statement fromLGBT Consortium: We cannot allow our communities, particularly our Trans and Intersex communities, to be attacked in such inhumane and degrading ways as we have seen during the Conservative Party Conference over the last week. Rather than focusing on pressing issues affecting everyone, such as the cost of living, the climate crisis or getting timely healthcare, senior Government ministers, including the Prime Minister, sought to denigrate Trans and Intersex people, and increase the barriers they already face to accessing essential services and support. We are deeply concerned at the nature and tone of these remarks and policies. Everyone has a right to live with dignity, free from discrimination and abuse, and to play an integral part in their local communities. That is the principle behind the Equality Act, which up until now has been supported by all parties. Government’s responsibility is to all its citizens and it should be working to proactively tackle life-limiting inequalities so that Trans people are safe to live their lives, respected and valued in society, and supported to thrive in what they do. However, Trans and Intersex people and communities are being let down by a Government that wants to deny their existence and their safety. For far too long now, we have seen Trans people and communities used in a culture war, mocked by those who are in positions of power, and inaccurately portrayed as a threat to others. People who support Trans people as friends, colleagues and family members are called ‘bullies’, and those questioning the Government’s new narrative in this area are removed from conversations. Announcements like the exclusion of Trans men and women from single-sex wards are made despite the NHS reporting no evidence of abuse by Trans people, and quite possibly with no consultation with those involved in providing or receiving those services. This suggests to the wider public that it is legitimate and appropriate to undertake harassment of Trans people and communities. We call upon LGBT+ people, friends, allies, family members, businesses and voluntary sector organisations to stand up and say enough. Enough of erasing and attacking some of the most marginalised people and communities in our society, and putting the health, safety and lives of Trans people at risk. Trans people, and all LGBT+ people, are an asset to our country. Reducing inequalities should be our collective goal. If the Government can target one group of innocent people, and block them from necessary services, then it can do the same to anyone else.

Rainbow Migration,Letter to the PM: Respect the lives of LGBTQI+ people and women seeking asylum in the UK,04-Oct-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/letter-to-the-pm-respect-the-lives-of-lgbtqi-people-and-women-seeking-asylum-in-the-uk/,"Together with 245 other organisations, we’ve joinedStonewallin a powerful display of solidarity, followingcomments by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, last week. The coalition, including organisations such asAmnesty,Oxfam,End Violence Against Women Coalition,Refugee CouncilandWomen For Refugee Women, has written to UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, to reaffirm the UK’s commitment to protecting LGBTQI+ people and women around the world. Many of the signatories work daily with LGBTQI+ and women refugees, and ‘bear witness to their scars from being persecuted’. The letter rejects Suella Braverman’s claim that LGBTQI+ people and women are misusing their identities to make false claims, and speaks of regret that the  Home Secretary’s selective use of stats that ‘have nothing to do with genuine concern or respect for international law, refugees or their protection.’ Robbie de Santos, Director of External Affairs at Stonewall, said:“We all deserve a government with the compassion and will to protect the most vulnerable in society. Not only is the incumbent UK Government failing LGBTQ+ people domestically, with inaction on rising hate crime, but they are also failing the international community by indicated their disdain for international law – in the process bringing great shame on party and country.” Steve Valdez-Symonds, Refugee and Migrant Rights Director at Amnesty International UK, said:“The Home Secretary’s verbal attack on the rights of LGBTQ+ and women refugees is deplorable. Not only did she once again stir utterly false prejudices against people seeking asylum, she also targeted refugees who often continue to face grave insecurity, hostility and violence – even long after escaping persecution and conflict. Ministers must stop their constant scapegoating and put their energy into repairing the utter wreckage they have made of the asylum system.” Alphonsine Kabagado, Director, Women For Refugee Women, said:“We strongly condemn Suella Braverman’s speech last week – which was dangerous, inflammatory and racist. Not only did her claims stoke hatred and fear, they were untrue. To be granted asylum in the UK, you must prove a well-founded fear of persecution. Her suggestion that people lie about their identities to make false claims for protection, or that it is possible to be granted asylum based on discrimination alone, is unfounded. We know from our work supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women, including LGBTQ+ women, that many face persecution including torture, gender-based violence, sexual violence, trafficking and rape. Braverman’s speech was also hypocritical. The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to tackling violence against women and supporting survivors of such violence, as well as to supporting LGBTQ+ people. Yet when it comes to women or LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum in the UK, it seems these commitments do not apply. Instead of whipping up hatred, fear, and division against women and LGBTQ+ people seeking safety, the Government should treat them with compassion and kindness. How we treat people is who we are; the Government’s hostility does not represent us.” Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said:“Turning our backs on LGBTQ+ people and suggesting they are undeserving of a fair hearing in the asylum system is immoral. Of the small number of people who come to the UK claiming asylum based on their sexual orientation, the majority are recognised as having a well-founded fear of persecution and are given refugee protection. We know from our work how traumatised they often are – what they need is support to restart their lives in safety, rather than hostility and disbelief. The Refugee Convention’s fundamental purpose is to offer protection to those who need it, based on shared global values of humanity and fairness. Abandoning these values does not reflect who we are as a country.” Leila Zadeh, CEO, Rainbow Migration, said:“Across the world there are LGBTQI+ people experiencing violence and persecution simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Around 70 countries still criminalise same-sex relations, and in some places the picture is getting worse. Many LGBTQI+ people that we support every day tell us how they faced life-threatening situations back home. For example, Olu, a lesbian from Nigeria had to run for her life when her husband found out she was a lesbian and nearly killed her, or Adams was violently attacked in the street on several occasions by members of his community in Ghana because he was bisexual. We all want to live somewhere where we can be safe and live fulfilling lives and most of us welcome people who are fleeing for their lives. We ask that the PM gets in line with public sentiment and commits to the protection of the rights of LGBTQ+ people seeking safety in the UK.” Disclaimer The content of this website is provided for general information only and should not be relied on as legal advice.

Rainbow Migration,Our response to the Home Secretary who thinks “being gay isn’t reason enough for asylum”,26-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/our-response-to-the-home-secretary-who-think-being-gay-isnt-reason-enough-for-asylum/,"We are appalled to hear that the Home Secretary is questioning the legitimacy of LGBTQI+ people claiming asylum in the UK. Many LGBTQI+ people that we support every day tell us how they faced life-threatening situations back home. For example, we have worked withAdams, who was violently attacked in the street on several occasions by members of his community in Ghana because he was bisexual, and his partner was killed. We also supportedMikiwhose brother threatened to kill him when he came out as a gay man in Azerbaijan. The government’sown statisticssuggest that only 2% of all asylum claims in 2022 included sexual orientation as a reason for needing protection. It is already the case that LGBTQI+ people must face a well-founded fear of persecution to qualify for refugee protection in the UK. They also face the enormous challenge of having to “prove” their sexual orientation or gender identity to get refugee status. Most of us welcome refugees and want to help people who are fleeing for their lives. The Home Secretary should stop her cruel rhetoric and instead create an asylum system that treats people with dignity and compassion.

Rainbow Migration,“To have our human rights respected and protected has changed so many lives forever.”,22-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/to-have-our-human-rights-respected-and-protected-has-changed-so-many-lives-forever/,"My name is Sasha Taylor. I currently live in the UK; I grew up between Guatemala and Mexico, where I volunteered with several organisations as a human rights activist. Thanks to this work I have spent time observing and listening to other people, and seen very closely how difficult, deplorable and unfair life is for an LGBT+ person in those countries. I know this myself through my own personal experiences; I know very well that there is no equality, respect, protection and fulfilment of LGBT+ life and human rights. Even when I saw, lived and faced very difficult situations, I tried to survive and have a life, but there comes a time in life when the mind, and your dignity and self-respect as a human being are not enough to hold on anymore, and that is what happened to me. Being a constant victim of sexual harassment, discrimination, physical and verbal aggression, I had no choice but to flee my country. “I’dlike to celebrateall thesupport Rainbow Migration gave meso I couldsettleinthe UK,and the impact that has had on me and my life and the lives of so many other people.” Yet once I left, I was sold and ended up as a victim of human trafficking. I managed to escape and returned to the UK, but I no longer trusted or believed in anyone. It took me days to get the courage to seek help. I eventually contacted the Samaritans, who put me in touch with other organisations, among them Rainbow Migration (then called UKLGIG). I still remember the day of my first appointment. I arrived near the building, it was about half a block away, for a moment I thought about turning back and not going in, I was struggling emotionally, because of everything that had happened to me. I was scared and distrustful of everything and everyone, but something made me not lose faith, I took courage and went in. The receptionist asked me to wait, then a Support Worker picked me up and we went into a small room. She introduced herself; she had a very friendly face. I felt she was very serene and respectful. She asked me what they could do for me. My English was very bad at that time, so we helped each other with a translation application. I introduced myself, I told her what had happened to me, I told her that I was tired of being a victim and that I needed help. I cried and unburdened myself at that moment, because after so long finally someone listened to me. Since then, I have remained in touch with Rainbow Migration. They helped me with my case, and found me the legal, social, medical and emotional support I needed. Thanks to all that support, today I am here, safe, and with a stable, peaceful and happy life. I’d like to celebrate all the support Rainbow Migration gave me so I could settle in the UK, and the impact that has had on me and my life and the lives of so many other people. To have our human rights respected and protected has changed so many lives forever.

Rainbow Migration,Brook House Inquiry findings: A gay man faced verbal homophobic abuse and was outed by staff in detention,19-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/brook-house-inquiry-findings-a-gay-man-faced-verbal-homophobic-abuse-and-was-outed-by-staff-in-detention/,"Thefirst public inquiryinto immigration detention in the UK, released today, found evidence that a gay man from Morocco had received verbal homophobic abuse from staff while held in immigration detention. The man told the Inquiry that “he did not feel detention was an environment where it was safe to be open about his sexuality” and that “he believed staff were hostile towards gay people”. The report details an incident where a member of staff at the Brook House immigration removal centre told him that he needed to change his clothes “because [he] looked gay” in front of other people in detention, which effectively outed him and caused him to feel unsafe in detention. The report found that the remark was “probably made with the express intention of humiliating” him, and that the officer was likely to know “that his specific choice of words could have placed [the gay man] at risk of harm”. “These findings show, once again, how dangerous immigration detention is for LGBTQI+ people”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration, and continued “LGBTQI+ people face high levels of harassment, abuse and violence from others who are detained or, as this Inquiry shows, even staff”. On top of that, facing abuse in detention can retraumatise LGBTQI+ people, as many will have fled persecution and are already trying to cope with experiences of trauma from their past. The case of mistreatment detailed above is one among a total of 19 incidents of mistreatment that were found by the Brook House inquiry in just a five-month period between April and August 2017. The report also catalogued a deeply troubling list of issues at the centre, including a dysfunctional safeguarding system, excessive and inappropriate use of force and the use of racist and abusive language towards people detained. Under the recently passed Illegal Migration Act, this governmentplans to increase the use of detention, which will put LGBTQI+ people seeking protection in even more dangerous situations. Recent UNHCR report findingssuggestthat supporting people who might otherwise be detained to navigate the asylum and immigration system in the community instead is better for their mental health and wellbeing, costs less than detaining them, and does not affect compliance with Home Office directives. “This government urgently needs to end the use of immigration detention and instead invest in tried and tested community-based approaches that do not carry the same human cost”, said Leila Zadeh. Further findings about the report have been reported byThe GuardianandThe Independent.

Rainbow Migration,“It’s like comparing night and day”: community-based alternatives to detention,15-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/its-like-comparing-night-and-day-community-based-alternatives-to-detention/,"Imagine a world in which people trying to make the UK their home were met with a supportive environment, not a hostile one. A world where people without immigration status were supported to understand their options and make informed decisions about their next steps, rather than being detained and threatened with removal. This approach is not only possible, but tried and tested within the UK. Following a recommendation fromStephen Shaw’s second report on immigration detentionin 2018, the Home Office commissioned a series of pilot projects to test community-based “alternatives to detention”, both of which have now concluded and been subject to an independent evaluation. The results of both initiatives are clear. Supporting people who might otherwise be detained to navigate the asylum and immigration system in the community instead:  We must remember that detaining people going through the asylum and immigration system is a choice our government makes. It’s a choice that destroys lives, tears communities apart and has devastating consequences for those who are locked up with no idea when they might be set free. It puts LGBTQI+ people ina dangerous situationwhere they face bullying, harassment and abuse. Nobody benefits from detention, except the private contractors who are paid millions of pounds a year to run the UK’s detention centres. But we could all benefit from an approach that sees people supported in our communities and empowered to make decisions that are right for them. For LGBTQI+ people who have fled persecution and could otherwise be detained here, it would mean having the chance to live openly and with dignity while they claim asylum in the UK. With an alternative on the table that is compassionate, humane and cost-effective we cannot let this government continue its plans to re-open Campsfield and Haslar detention centres and tender for three new centres as well. Help spread the word about compassionate alternatives to detention byemailing your MP. Read on to learn more about the two pilot projects.  King’s Arms Project – Refugee and Migrant Advice Service Last month UNHCRpublished the evaluation of a pilot projectdelivered by the King’s Arms Project (KAP) in Bedford. Between 2020 and 2022, 84 people without immigration status who were liable to detention were supported in the community through KAP’s Refugee and Migrant Advice Service (RMAS). People taking part in the pilot received free, high-quality legal counselling and one-to-one support from a caseworker. That one-to-one support was flexible and tailored to individual needs – for example help with accessing healthcare, setting up bank accounts, social inclusion or accessing training/volunteer opportunities. By the end of the pilot,80% of people had been offered viable options to regularise their immigration status. They experienced better self-esteem and wellbeing, a better understanding of their legal options, and increased confidence and ability to access entitlements. As a result they were able to make informed decisions about their situation. NatCen, who evaluated the project, estimated the pilot to betwo-thirds cheaper than it would have been to detain the individuals supported. “It’slike comparing day and night. King’s Arms Project is like the day where the sun is out and my life before was like in the night, without stars.” Action Foundation – Action Access RMAS was preceded byAction Access, delivered by the Action Foundation in Newcastle from 2019 – 2021. That project supported women seeking asylum in the UK, most of whom were detained in Yarl’s Wood prior to joining the pilot. As with RMAS, the women were given legal counselling and one-to-one support, however the Action Access pilot also provided them with shared accommodation and subsistence payments. Unsurprisingly,the women moved from detention to this project experienced immediate improvements to their health and wellbeing. They experienced greater stability while on the pilot, and were better able to understand their options and make informed decisions about their asylum cases. Despite being hampered by the coronavirus pandemic and having to run below capacity, Action Access was cheaper per participant per night than detention. In the evaluation NatCen estimated that potential savings from extending the pilot (e.g. running it at capacity and entering into longer leases to save on rents) could see the cost come down toless than half the cost of detaining someone. “In detention, youdon’thave this kind of positive atmosphere. You just want to cry. You just want to stop eating. You just want to kill yourself. This is because you are so in trouble there, right. Then, when you come out,it’slike everything is going to be nice again… the atmosphere isvery different, andI think yourecover yourself.” For more information see: UNHCR’s summary of the two pilot projects NatCen evaluation of the Refugee and Migrant Advice Service (RMAS) NatCen evaluation of Action Access Disclaimer The content of this website is provided for general information only and should not be relied on as legal advice.

Rainbow Migration,More Albanian LGB+ people granted asylum despite country considered ‘safe‘ under new Illegal Migration Act,13-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/more-albanian-lgb-people-granted-asylum-despite-country-considered-safe-under-new-illegal-migration-act/,"New statisticsshow that the number of people from Albania that were recognised[1]as being at risk of persecution due to their sexual orientation in the UK in 2022 more than doubled compared to 2021, it went up from five to thirteen people Albania is one of the countries deemed ‘safe’ underthe recently passed Illegal Migration Act. “By granting asylum to LGB Albanians, this government is acknowledging that Albania is a dangerous country for the community, where they can face life-threatening situations”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration, and added, “However, when the Illegal Migration Act fully comes into force, LGBTQI+ people could be sent to Albania or any other of the 56 countries that this government considers safe”. Hamez, a gay man who fled to the UK from Albania explained last year that: “It was very scary to go back to Albania. My family were pressuring me to get married, and when my parents found out that I was gay, my father chased me out of the house with an axe. I had brought shame on my family, and my father began to be physically abusive. I was hiding in the mountains, trying to find a way to escape my village. It is common for people to get beaten up or killed in my country if someone is found out to be gay.” The statistics also show that the number of LGB people from Nigeria and Ghana that were granted asylum remained steady, 52 and 9 respectively, two countries that are also considered ‘safe’ (in respect of men) under the Illegal Migration Act.  More LGB Ugandans seeking refuge in the UK According to the statistics, up to 54% of the applications received from Ugandan nationals were LGB applications. Over the last year and a half, we’ve supported more than 20 Ugandan LGBTQI+ people to seek protection here and we are concerned that the discriminatory law that was passed in Uganda a few months ago, under which LGBTQI+ people can face life in prison or even the death penalty, will mean many more will have no choice but to flee Uganda. The Illegal Migration Act will make it almost impossible for LGBTQI+ Ugandans to find safety in the UK. If they do, they could be detained and later sent to another dangerous country for LGBTQI+ people. “The inhumane Illegal Migration act should never come into force. Instead, this government should focus on creating a compassionate and caring asylum system that treats people with kindness” said Leila Zadeh.  [1]The experimental statistics show the number of asylum claims where sexual orientation was raised as a basis, or part of the basis, of the claim.

Rainbow Migration,Celebrating 30 years together!,04-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/celebrating-30-years-together/,"This year marks a significant milestone for us as we proudlycelebrate three decades of supporting LGBTQI+ peoplethrough the immigration and asylum system. In the 90s, a group of lesbian, gay and bisexual couples, and their lawyers, campaigned to make it possible for the partner of a British citizen in a same sex relationship to remain in the UK. This was how Rainbow Migration was originally formed. Since then, we’ve continued to campaign for the right of LGBTQI+ people to rebuild their lives free from homophobia, biphobia and/or transphobia here in the UK.

Rainbow Migration,“I am proud of the work we did together”,01-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/i-am-proud-of-the-work-we-did-together/,"I’ve been involved with the organisation for 25 years, since 1998. At the time it was called the Stonewall Immigration Group (SIG). I’d met the person who was to become my life partner, from Thailand, and we were looking at ways to stay together. We began looking for people who could help us and heard about the SIG telephone helpline. After a couple of initial phone calls, I went along to some of the in-person meetings, where LGBTQI+ couples met with lawyers for legal advice. These sessions were very helpful for my own personal situation, but I also became more interested in the Group’s underlying mission to change immigration law. Before I knew it, I started volunteering. As a volunteer, I was able to meet both service users and the volunteer solicitors every month, both in the meetings and socially afterwards. It was hugely reassuring to know that so many people were confronting similar issues and as a bonus I met people who have become very good friends. Eventually I took more of a role in the running of the organisation, becoming a committee member. In summer 2000, when we suddenly found ourselves without an office, I built the original, very basic website in 3 weeks and rebuilt it twice in subsequent years. I didn’t have any previous training, experience or knowledge of website design, but I really enjoyed the challenge, and it was very satisfying when some of the people who came to the Saturday meetings told us how critical it had been to their understanding of their situation. I am told that many couples were able to make straightforward applications without using a solicitor, with the help of the website and forum. “Though theinitialpurpose of the grouphadbeen achieved,itdidn’tmeanour workwas done.Very quickly it was decided, given our established and growing profile, to refocus the mission of the group towards the support of LGBTQI+people seekingasylum.” The work of the Committee in those early days involved coordination of the effort to change the law and planning for the future of the organisation. The Unmarried Partners Concession which was announced not long after New Labour took office in 1997, became law in October 2000, effectively achieving immigration equality for same-sex couples and of course equality then came more widely with Civil Partnerships in 2005. Though the initial purpose of the group had been achieved, it didn’t mean our work was done. Very quickly it was decided, given our established and growing profile, to refocus the mission of the group towards the support of LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum.I became Chair just as the Asylum Support Project was set up with a part time project manager. In early 2004, SIG rebranded to become the UK Gay and Lesbian Immigration Group (UKLGIG) and achieved charitable status. For many years we depended on the generosity of our founders such as Matthew Davies, Mark Watson and Wesley Gryk; by 2006, thanks to increasingly effective fundraising, we were in a position to hire our first Executive Director, Dr. Sebastian Rocca, and we moved into our first permanent office in 2007. It was a very stimulating time to be involved with the organisation; there were huge challenges, but we were encouraged by a growing number of successes. I was always conscious, however, that neither I nor my partner had any lived experience of being an LGBTQI+ refugee or someone seeking asylum. After 2 or 3 years as chair, I decided to step aside for someone with more relevant experience, although I continued helping to run partnership meetings and maintained the group website until 2020. When I first volunteered, I was on duty once a week on the phone lines and once a month at the Saturday meetings. Becoming involved with the organisation like this gave me a new, positive purpose; it was a real pleasure to do something good for people who needed support.I am proud of the work we did together. We and our core group of volunteer solicitors weren’t just campaigners who aimed to be a nuisance to the government. We developed a thoughtful style of gentle persuasion, education, and training. We understood that we couldn’t just scream and shout, despite the injustices all around us. We often faced political, public and tabloid backlash, but we kept going; we achieved so much by maintaining a standard we could sustain through quiet dedication and diligence. “My personal connection with the organisation has been a liberating and highly positive experience, which I continue to value and treasure.” Of course, not everything has always gone according to plan. Public support for LGBTQI+ migrants isn’t commonly flavour of the month, and over the years much of the right-wing press has had no problem reminding us of that. But such biased coverage also meant that good people heard about us and sought us out to show their support. Being part of the charity has been a great privilege for me. It has given me the opportunity for experiences I would have been unlikely to encounter otherwise, meeting people from a diverse range of backgrounds. Former executive director Erin Power called us “unlikely friends”. Such friendships have opened my mind, almost certainly been closer as a result, and taken me in new, exciting directions. UKLGIG became Rainbow Migration after a rebrand in 2020, and I am proud to see them continue to go from strength to strength. My personal connection with the organisation has been a liberating and highly positive experience, which I continue to value and treasure.

Rainbow Migration,“Rainbow Migration has a lot to celebrate!”,01-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/rainbow-migration-has-alot-to-celebrate/,"I first came across Rainbow Migration soon after I arrived in the UK in 2017. At the time I was identifying as a gay man. One of the very first things I did was research support for LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. I found the Rainbow Migration website, which was so helpful and informative, and contacted them about their group meetings. Knowing an organisation like this existed, with in-person support, made me feel safer. I went to a meeting in Birmingham and met a support worker from Rainbow Migration. Even though my English was terrible, I was treated with so much kindness. The support worker was really helpful; she explained what I needed to do and helped me feel less panicked. When you start the asylum process, you’re not an expert, you don’t know anything. you don’t understand what will happen. I was very scared. The support worker really calmed me down and reassured me. It was exactly what I needed. I had just escaped my country.The support worker explained the asylum process to me and advised me to contact the Home Office. Thanks to the Rainbow Migration support worker, I contacted the Home Office, who moved me to Liverpool, and I began to feel a bit happier. Having faced persecution and discrimination in my country of origin, I was able to start exploring my gender identity in the UK. I felt free in Liverpool; I was able to wear what I wanted and to really be myself. Finally, I felt safe to come out as non-binary. I got granted refugee status in 2020. I was the first person to be granted asylum in the UK on the basis of being non-binary. “Rainbow Migration has a lot to celebrate, and I am proud to be part of that. ItIs so important to so many people and should be proud of all it does.” In 2022 I began working with Rainbow Migration as a volunteer for theirNo Pride In Detentioncampaign. Kiki, one of the trustees, asked me if I wanted to be part of the campaigns advisory group; I was so grateful for the opportunity. As part of the group, I’ve contributed to the production of the campaign film, spoken at National Student Pride, recorded a podcast, and helped out at events. It has given me the chance to learn professional skills, to have a say about issues important to me, to express myself, and meet lots of new people. Being part of the campaign has also led to new opportunities for collaboration and has really helped me grow as a person. Being part ofNo Pride In Detentionhas had such a positive impact on my development. Rainbow Migration has a lot to celebrate, and I am proud to be part of that. We are on the right side of history. While rights are consistently under threat, in the UK, and the rest of the world, we will always fight to protect LGBTQI+ people who are seeking safety. It’s scary to go through uncertain times, but organisations like Rainbow Migration make such a difference to so many people’s lives. In the future, I really hope the organisation can keep expanding its services for trans people in the asylum system. Without that support, many would be invisible, and even more marginalised and isolated than they already are. Rainbow Migration Is so important to so many people and should be proud of all it does.

Rainbow Migration,We are celebrating our 30th anniversary: “I love being part of it”,01-Sep-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/we-are-celebrating-our-30th-anniversary-i-love-being-part-of-it/,"I first heard about Rainbow Migration in May 2007, after I started transitioning and began to support other trans men. I had a passion for human rights issues and was attending a trans support group, eventually joining their committee. I helped out by answering enquiry emails. One email was from a trans man who wanted help with their transition, but who also needed to claim asylum. I was unsure how to help someone in the asylum system, so I sought advice elsewhere. I contacted Stephen Whittle, an LGBTQI+ activist and trans man, and he suggested the Rainbow Migration legal advice meetings, so I accompanied the service user to one of these meetings. It was in a big room, with many other LGBTQI+ people claiming asylum present. Volunteer lawyers explained the process, and afterwards we had a private conversation with a solicitor. Thanks to their advice, I helped him start the application process. The meeting was a real eye-opener for me. I was blown away by how awful and dehumanising the process is for LGBTQI+ people. I was dismayed by how much evidence people needed to provide to “prove” they are LGBTQI+. It was a wake-up call and convinced me to get more involved with supporting LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum, so I began volunteering with Rainbow Migration. I went along to the meetings to help Sebastian Rocca, Erin Power, and Jill Power. They were all great to work with. I eventually began to support a few more trans men who were claiming asylum. It took a long time, but they all got granted refugee status. “I am particularly proudof our work influencing the new ruling in2009thatmeantLGBTQI+ people who come here seeking safetycouldn’tjust be told to “go home and hide”.That decision hada huge impacton the people we support.” In 2013 I was made redundant; at the same time Erin decided to leave Rainbow Migration. With more time on my hands, I took on more voluntary duties. Erin trained me in bookkeeping, admin, and organising meetings. At the time everything was being run by the trustees, especially Tim Barndon, Jackie Peirce, and Bojana Asanovic. They were very proactive and a great source of support. Eventually they hired a new Executive Director, Paul Dillane, and he secured the funding to offer me paid employment. Working at Rainbow Migration means a lot to me. There’s something about being a refugee that touches me on a very deep level. For people to lose everything they know and love, to not have a home, and yet still have the will to come and start again and build a future in a completely new place and go through a difficult system, says so much about the strength refugees possess. Supporting refugees alongside such a great team really gives me something to feel good about. I am particularly proud of our work influencing the new ruling in 2009 that meant LGBTQI+ people who come here seeking safety couldn’t just be told to “go home and hide”. That decision had a huge impact on the people we support. “I love working for Rainbow Migration.It’svery emotional work for me, andI’mso happy to see theorganisationcontinue togrow. Leila and the trustees have done an amazing job attracting a fantastic group of professionals who know how to do their job so well. I love being part of it and am so grateful to be here.” I am also so proud of how much we’ve grown in recent years, especially since Leila Zadeh was made Executive Director in 2017, and Dane became our Support Services Manager. They’ve built a stronger support structure, and made it safer for everyone, services users and staff alike. They have improved our services, which are more organised and supportive for our service users. Moving offices, to a more private space, has also improved safeguarding. Securing new roles, such as a Legal Officer, has made a tremendous difference as well. I was also so impressed with the way the organisation moved to an online space for remote working during the COVID lockdown. We worked together as a team to maintain support for our service users during a particularly difficult time. While we have so much to be proud of from the last 30 years, there are many things I hope we can celebrate in the future. I really wish for a safe route for people coming here. We need the government to realise that we are not a fortress. People have the right to live in a place that isn’t going to harm them for being who they are. We need to make space for people. We need to care about each other more. I love working for Rainbow Migration. It’s very emotional work for me, and I’m so happy to see the organisation continue to grow. The new policies, safeguarding measures, and the wellbeing activities have all been such welcome, positive developments in the last few years. Leila and the trustees have done an amazing job attracting a fantastic group of professionals who know how to do their job so well. I love being part of it and am so grateful to be here.

Rainbow Migration,Tell your MP about alternatives to detention,29-Aug-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/tell-your-mp-about-alternatives-to-detention/,"We all know thatimmigration detention is unjust and inhumane. Now the UN Refugee Agencyhas published evidenceshowing that a new compassionate approach could be a reality in the UK. We need MPs to see this report. The report covers two UK pilot projects where people were supported with their asylum or immigration cases in the community rather than being detained. Compared to locking people up in detention, providing legal counselling and personalised support in the community wasmore humaneand resulted insignificant improvements in mental healthand wellbeing. At the same time, there wasno evidence of reduced compliancewith the Home Office and the projects were bothcheaperand offeredbetter value for moneythan detention. So why is this government doubling down and planning to open three new detention centres? The harm that detention causes is unjustifiable.

Rainbow Migration,LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum will not be safe on barges,27-Jul-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/lgbtqi-people-seeking-asylum-will-not-be-safe-on-barges/,"Micro Rainbow and Rainbow Migration firmly condemn this government’s barbaric proposal to house people seeking asylum on barges. Wesupport Refugee Council’s open letterto Bibby Marine and agree that barges are unsuitable for housing people seeking asylum in the UK. Furthermore, the doubling of the capacity of the barge, and the movement restrictions placed on the people housed there resemble immigration detention, where LGBTQI+ people are particularly at risk of harm. The overcrowded accommodation and the restrictions on movement for the people living at the Bibby Stockholm will replicate many of the conditions of incarceration. Housing people in prison-like conditions such as those proposed on the Bibby Stockholm risk further traumatising people who are seeking safety and protection. The risks of forced isolation and prison conditions is well known: it is a key facet of Australian border policy. This policy has a detrimental impact on both mental and physical health, andthe UK Government knows this.The situation will be even more dire for LGBTQI+ people. We know that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are particularly at risk of harm and can face serious issues when forced to live in overcrowded conditions. Like in detention, they are likely to experience discrimination and harassment from other people seeking asylum who can hold LGBTQI-phobic views. Trans people can be at even greater risk of abuse and may be forced to hide their gender identity. Rainbow Migration’s 2023pilot study into LGBTQI+ experiences of detentionunderlines the fact that detention-like conditions are unsafe for LGBTQI+ people. It is clear that the conditions on the Bibby Stockholm will differ from immigration detention in name only, and are likely to put LGBTQI+ people at increased risk of harm. Instead, a holistic and community-based response is better suited to safeguarding LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. Micro Rainbow’s tested and successful holistic approach to integration incorporates housing, social-inclusion and moving-on support, and it is a viable and empathetic alternative. Micro Rainbow’s housing is safe, inclusive for LGBTQI+ people, and integrated into the community. People seeking asylum staying in Micro Rainbow housing are not only safe to express their LGBTQI+ identity but also better able to establish community links and networks of support. They can openly and safely contribute to their local communities. Micro Rainbow and Rainbow Migration ask that this government commits to the safeguarding of LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum, and guarantees that LGBTQI+ people will not be housed on barges.

Rainbow Migration,Thank you for speaking out,21-Jul-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/thank-you-for-speaking-out/,"This week the government’s cruelRefugee Ban Billwas passed by Parliament and became law.We are angry and disappointed, but we won’t stop fighting to make the UK a safe and welcoming place for LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum. This law will deny the right to asylum to thousands of people who need our protection. It will dramatically increase the government’s powers tolock people upwhile making it even harder to challenge their detention. And it will put LGBTQI+ lives at risk by allowing people to be sent to countries that are not safe for the LGBTQI+ community. We wanted to say thanks to each and every one of you who took the time to write to your MP last weekend.Because of you, the need to protect LGBTQI+ people from being sent to countries where they would be at risk of harm was raised by MPs throughout the debate.We were pleased to see the amendment drew support across political parties. We are sad to say that we could not change the bill on this occasion, but thank you for speaking out for LGBTQI+ people and showing that whatever this government says, these cruel laws do not represent us.

Rainbow Migration,How the UK government is turning a blind eye to the discrimination that LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum will face if sent to Rwanda,04-Jul-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/how-the-uk-government-is-turning-a-blind-eye-to-the-discrimination-that-lgbtq-people-seeking-asylum-will-face-if-sent-to-rwanda/,"By *Innocent Uwimana, a gay man from Rwanda who migrated to the UK around 20 years ago. This article was originally published byPink News.  If theRefugee Ban Billthat is currently going through Parliament is passed into law, LGBTQI+ people who come to the UK seeking protection could be sent to countries which are not safe for them, such as Rwanda. I had the chance to speak to a group of LGBTQ+ Rwandans in the country, who told me about the discrimination they have faced their entire lives because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. During an anonymous meeting online, they expressed their concerns about their lives and explained the risks LGBTQI+ people face in Rwanda. “We don’t understand how the UK government would send LGBTQ+ people here knowing that they will face discrimination. Though the country’s recent human rights advances have been ‘enormous’, not all Rwandans are able to enjoy them equally Indeed, Rwanda is one of the few African countries that doesnot overtly criminalise gay sex,and the country is asignatory to the UN declaration condemning violence against LGBTQ+ people.However, same-sex marriage is prohibited and LGBTQ+ people are not protected from discrimination by any specific legislation. LGBTQ+ people face stigmatisation and abuse in Rwanda every day, and there are many cultural and religious factors which fuel hatred against LGBTQI+ people in Rwandan society.” The people in the group said that religious and cultural arguments are often used to heavily discriminate against anyone perceived to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community.  Religion as an argument to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. Religion is the most common argument people in Rwanda use against LGBTQI+ people. Because of the predominance of Christianity in Rwanda, churches have been particularly vocal in fuelling discrimination against Rwandan LGBTQ+ people. Leaders of the Pentecostal and Catholic churcheshave embraced and been keen to demonstrate bigoted attitudes towards the LGBTQI+ population. In addition, many political and social influencers in Rwandafrequently utilise overtly religious justifications to condemn homosexuality, calling it not only “un-Rwandan,” but also “sacrilegious”. The UK government needs to understand that Rwandans’ conceptions of the world are substantially shaped by their religious beliefs, and that religious ideas heavily shape their attitudes and behaviours. Hostility on the grounds of culture On the other hand, some Rwandan leaders, including political and religious leaders, as well as social media influencers, justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people on the grounds of culture. They claim that homosexuality and non-heteronormative gender identities are not part of the African culture and that theywere brought to Africa by Western countries(especially the US and European countries) so as to impose their cultures on Africa. Some also claimthat Western countries intend to wipe out the African population by promoting homosexuality and discouraging people from heterosexual relationships in which they can have children. In Rwanda, homophobia has evolved into a rallying cry that mobilises the masses by urging them to guard themselves against westernisation and to defend their own culture. However, there is well documented historical evidence of same sex relationships and gender expression variance in many places in Africa, including Rwanda. For example, in Rwanda ‘Cyabakobwa’ (men behaving and dressing as women) and ‘Ibishebago’ (women behaving and dressing as men) were well tolerated and lived in peace in the communities in pre-colonial times. Yet unfortunately this is no longer the case, and LGBTQ+ individuals must hide who they are, or are forced to flee to other nations. The controversial cases of a Rwandan fashion star and a social media influencer The group highlighted the recent case of Moses Turahirwa, a Rwandan fashion star, to illustrate the hostility against LGBTQI+ people in the country. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB)arrested this well-known Rwandan fashion designeron Thursday, April 27 in Kigali. The day before, he uploaded a photo to social media joking about the fact that his passport’s “gender” field had been changed from “M” to “F,” meaning male to female. “Finally, officially a woman on my identity card”, said the artist, who is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. However, the joke sparked lots of hate speech and discrimination against people perceived to be part of the LGBTQ+ community on the grounds of religious and culture arguments. Many people have expressed that LGBTQ+ people should be killed, and the authorities have turned a blind eye to the situation. The government responded by arresting him. On top of being accused of forging official documents, he was also accused of other crimes and the investigation will continue while he remains in custody. Hostility against LGBTQ+ people in Rwanda can also be illustrated by the recent case of a famous DJ and social media influencer who has been accused of being a lesbian. Despite her denying this, many religious leaders and social media influencershave attacked her on the mediaclaiming that she should be arrested or beaten up.  “We hope the UK government will hear our voice” Most LGBTQI+ people want to leave Rwanda. They want to live in a place where they can be free and themselves. So why would the UK government think it is safe to send LGBTQ+ people there? The group of people I chatted to were surprised that a country like the UK, previously known as respecting human rights, is now consciously planning to send LGBTQI+ people to a place where it is known they will face stigmatisation and discrimination. When asked what they hope for from the conversation, the group said, “we hope that the UK government will hear our voice and not put other people in a situation so many others want to get out of. “  *The name of the author has been changed to protect his identity.

Rainbow Migration,MPs raise concerns about this government’s plans to detain and send LGBTQI+ people to Rwanda,27-Jun-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/mps-raise-concerns-about-this-governments-plans-to-detain-and-send-lgbtqi-people-to-rwanda/,"Anew reporton equality and the UK asylum process by the Women and Equalities Committee highlights that new legislation could put LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum at greater risk of harm. Committee Chair, Caroline Nokes MP said: “We were disturbed by the Home Office’s inadequate management of risks of harm to asylum seekers with protected characteristics, including women, LGBT people, children and disabled people. Alarmingly, these risks will increase under the Government’s recent and planned reforms.” Immigration detention and Rwanda MPs are “deeply concerned that the current and planned reforms risk turning back the clock on policies intended to ensure detention is used only as a last resort, and to reduce the risks of harm to vulnerable people.” If theRefugee Ban Billis passed into law, more people could be detained for longer periods of time. This would include LGBTQI+ people, who in detention face bullying, harassment and abuse, with serious consequences for their mental health. The reportrecommends this government set out how it plans to mitigate the risks of harm to LGBTQI+ people indetention, and to collect and monitor data on where LGBTQI+ people are detained and for how long. At the moment, the government does not keep track of LGBTQI+ people in detention, which means that they cannot monitor and reduce the harm of detention to LGBTQI+ people. MPs also expressed their worries about this government’s plans to send LGBTQI+ people to Rwanda andurged it to “set out how it intends to monitor and ensure those removed to Rwanda do not suffer harm or experience discrimination in that country”. At Rainbow Migration,we have called out Rwanda as a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that it LGBTQI+ Rwandans have sought asylum in the UK. “This report, for which Rainbow Migration gave oral and written evidence, is sending a very clear message to this government. The inhumane policies towards people seeking asylum in the UK have to stop immediately. This government’s legislation will put LGBTQI+ people seeking protection in dangerous situations, by detaining them in greater numbers and sending them to countries where they could face discrimination and violence”, said Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration, “instead, this government needs to focus on creating a compassionate and caring asylum system that treats people with kindness”. Dangerous accommodation arrangements for LGBTQI+ people The report also highlights that new contingency accommodation, such as military barracks and barges, being used by this government to house people wanting to rebuild their lives in the UK, is “unacceptable from both safeguarding and equalities perspective”, as it puts LGBTQI+ people at heightened risk of hate crime. Leila Zadeh gave examples of the harassment and abuse experienced by LGBTQI+ people in government-provided accommodation. She explained that in the case of one man in military barracks, he was “ harassed by the others there, and there was no private space—the showers were communal, and they were sleeping in dorms, effectively. We worked very hard with other partner NGOs to try to get this person out but, to our knowledge, vulnerable people are being placed in accommodation like barracks and other forms of contingency accommodation which are completely unsuitable.

Rainbow Migration,4 ways in which you can support LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum,01-Jun-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/4-ways-in-which-you-can-support-lgbtqi-people-seeking-asylum/,"One group that often faces particularly difficult challenges is LGBTQI+ people seeking protection in the UK. They have fled persecution and discrimination in their home countries due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and are seeking safety and a chance to rebuild their lives here. Instead of welcoming them and giving them the support they need,this government is telling them that they’ll be punished for coming here, locked up and sent away toanother country, perhaps one they’ve never heard of, and that may be dangerous for LGBTQI+ people. If you are also outraged by the way LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are treated by this government, here are 4 ways in which you can do something for them during this month – it takes less than a minute per action. Make sure to share this with as many friends as possible!  1. Sign our petition and tell the Prime Minister to ditch his cruel and unworkable Refugee Ban Bill If theRefugee Ban Billbecomes law, LGBTQI+ people who come here seeking protection and safety will face a high probability of being placed in immigration detention. In detention LGBTQI+ people face bullying, harassment and abuse, with serious consequences for their mental health. Following detention they could be sent to countries that are dangerous for LGBTQI+ people and where they don’t have any connections or support. Places like Rwanda, where LGBTQI+ people face discrimination and violence,asInnocent explained. It’s not too late for the Prime Minister to stop this – sign our petition to show these cruel plans do not represent us. 2. Ask your MP to oppose LGBTQI+ detention The number of people being detained in this country has been climbing, and this government still plans to open more detention centres and seek greater powers to detain. Together with the University of Brighton we recently releaseda new pilot studyinto LGBTQI+ experiences of immigration detention since September 2016, which indicates that LGBTQI+ people continue to face harassment, bullying and deteriorating mental health while in immigration detention. Click below to ask your MP if they will oppose LGBTQI+ detention. 3. Join our ‘No Pride in Detention’ campaign You can also join our ‘No Pride in Detention’ campaign . Let’s come together and make sure no LGBTQI+ person is locked up and subjected to violence and abuse in detention. Add your name to say enough is enough: it’s time to #EndLGBTQIDetention. 4. Donate some much needed money We’re working in a challenging environment at the moment, where LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are not made to feel welcome in the UK and government policies are putting people’s lives at risk.

Rainbow Migration,Understanding immigration detention – part 2,25-May-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/understanding-immigration-detention-part-2/,"This is the second of a two-part blog answering some of the mostfrequentlyasked questions we get on social media about our No Pride in Detention campaign.  How many people in immigration detention are LGBTQI+? We cannot be sure of how many LGBTQI+ people are in detention, because this government does not collect or monitor the data. TheHome Affairs Select Committeehas criticised the government for not collecting data on this, as it makes it impossible to accurately identify how many LGBTQI+ people are being detained. What we do know is that even one LGBTQI+ person being locked up for months on end and subjected to bullying, is one too many. Is there anything official, or any studies, which prove that LGBTQI+ people face violence in detention centres? Together with Stonewall, we publishedNo Safe Refugein 2016. The report highlighted the systemic discrimination, abuse and harassment that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum faced both by staff and other people detained.The findings were stark – they faced physical and verbal abuse, deteriorating mental health, inadequate medical care and discriminatory attitudes from staff. Earlier this year, theUniversity of Brightonpublisheda pilot studythat found that UK detention centres continue to be very dangerous places for LGBTQI+ people, with participants reporting attacks from other detained people and inaction from staff in the face of escalating abuse. On top of the UK evidence, similar conclusions have been reached internationally. The International Detention Coalitionpublished a reportin June 2016 reiteratingthat marginalised individuals should never be placed in immigration detention. Their report found that “LGBTQI+ persons face heightened levels of harassment, discrimination, psychological abuse, physical and sexual violence by detention staff as well as other detainees. They are frequently segregated in conditions falling below those of the general detainee population and well-established international standards, or are subjected to policies of solitary confinement, which have been shown to have severe mental and physical health consequences.Almost universally, LGBTQI+ people in detention are in situations of extreme vulnerability”. And in its detention guidelines,the UNHCR (the UN agency responsible for monitoring and protecting refugees)warns that measures must be taken to avoid exposing LGBTQI+ people to the risk of violence or abuse in detention. Where their safety cannot be ensured, alternatives to detention must be considered. The guidelines suggest that LGBTQI+ people should never be kept in isolation or confinement, that all detention staff should be aware and trained in issues relating to LGBTQI+ people, and that LGBTQI+ people should have access to appropriate healthcare and counselling.  What would a victory look like for you and your campaign? A win would mean lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer people are included in theAdults at RiskPolicy. We also need to see improvements to that policy, to ensure that those at risk of harm are correctly identified and excluded from detention. Ending the detention of LGBTQI+ people who are fleeing persecution in their home countries would help keep them safer in the UK. No-one should be locked away as punishment for seeking safety. Supporting people in the community would give LGBTQI+ people the chance to live with dignity and to be open about who they are while they pursue permission to stay in the UK. It would give them a better chance to gather evidence and find appropriate legal representation for their claims. We also want the government to set a time limit of 28 days on all detention, to limit the harms that it is causing to everyone affected – not just the LGBTQI+ community. These wins would be the start of a much-needed overhaul of the UK’s asylum and detention system. We hope it would lead on to meaningful investment in alternatives to detention, declining numbers being detained, and ultimately the end of the use of immigration detention in the UK.

Rainbow Migration,Understanding immigration detention,02-May-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/understanding-immigration-detention/,"Immigration detention is a complex issue that does not always get the attention that a scandal on this scale deserves. As a result, many people are unaware of how itoperatesand who is affected.Weoften get askedwhat immigration detention is, why it is so dangerous for LGBTQI+ people, and howpeople can help.This is the first of a two-part blog answering some of themostfrequentlyaskedquestionswe geton social mediaabout our No Pridein Detention campaign.  How many detention centres are there, and where are they? There are currently seven immigration detention centres (officially known as immigration removal centres) in the UK: But in 2022,this government announced plans to reopentwo more centres: in Campsfield, in Oxfordshire, andHaslarin Gosport, Hampshire. This will allow the government to hold up to an extra thousand people in the immigration detention estate. The government also operates a number of “short term holding facilities”. These are places to detain those who have just arrived in the UK for shorter periods of time while the Home Office assesses their case. Would it be discriminatory to only keep LGBTQI+ people out of detention? Like many other organisations and people in society, we think that detention is unjust and damaging to everyone. But evidence shows that LGBTQI+ people (alongside other groups like pregnant women and survivors of torture) are at even greater risk of harm when detained. We want to see an end to detention in the UK, but while it remains a part of the UK immigration system, we want anyone at additional risk of harm to be kept out of it. The government already has a list of characteristics or experiences that may indicate a person is at greater risk of harm if detained, and that list already includes trans and intersex people. We want the whole LGBTQI+ community to be included in recognition of the risks they face. There isevidencethat LGBTQI+ people are particularly unsafe in detention and should not be detained. They experience bullying, harassment and abuse. This can be from members of staff or from other people who have been detained, who may hold the very same homophobic and transphobic attitudes that LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum are trying to flee. The situation is urgent. If this government’s new Refugee Ban Bill becomes law, there will be a drastic increase in the number of people detained, as a punishment for seeking asylum. To protect the wellbeing of LGBTQI+ people who are seeking safety in the UK, it is vital to end LGBTQI+ detention.  What are the specific dangers that LGBTQI+ people face within detention? In immigration detention,LGBTQI+ people face high levels ofharassment, abuse and violencefrom others who are detained, or even staff, who ought to be protecting them. Staff in detention centres are supposed to keep people who are detained safe, yet many lack knowledge of LGBTQI+ specific needs, and might even have discriminatory views of their own. In arecent pilot study, LGBTQI+ people in detention spoke about receiving verbal homophobic abuse from staff, and about staff failing to stop physical attacks from others in detention. Others who were interviewed did not report the LGBTQI-phobic abuse they had experienced as they did not feel they would be believed or supported by staff. Facing abuse in detention can retraumatise LGBTQI+ people. In ourNo Safe Refugestudy, Gasha from Cameroon said; “I got flashbacks of everything I’ve been through in Africa. I’ve been free for two or three years and then here I am back in a cell”.  If youdon’twant immigration detention for LGBTQI+ people, what do you think about detention in general? Is there another or better way to deal with asylum claims, or people who might need to be removed? Immigration detention is inhumane and expensive, causing long-term damage to the lives of those detainedandtearing families apart. Although detention should normally only be used when someone is about to be removed from the UK, in the year ending September 2022, ofthepeople leaving detention,83% were released back into the community.Supporting people to get help with their immigration status while living in the community can help them to resolve their cases without the human and economic cost that detention brings. At the moment,community-based case management approaches are being tested across Europe. Thefirst project to report back in the UKfound that providing vulnerable women who were seeking asylum with shared accommodation, intensive support and legal advice in the community: Although this government has officially accepted the recommendations from the evaluation of this pilot, instead of following the evidence they are increasing the use of detention. With an expanding detention estate and new legislation that significantly extends the government’s powers to detain, we need to protect those most at risk more than ever.

Rainbow Migration,Help direct the future of Rainbow Migration,18-Apr-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/help-direct-the-future-of-rainbow-migration/,"***This opportunity has now closed*** Would you like to join our board of trustees? At Rainbow Migrationwe are currently on the lookout for one or two new trustees.

Will I be able to work with service users? The role of trustees is to govern the charity and ensure we are meeting the purpose for which we exist. You won’t have much involvement in the day-to-day work for the charity, so contact with service users will be limited. I don’t have a computer. Is that a problem? We don’t want technology to be a barrier to becoming a trustee. It’s helpful if you have a smartphone, at least, so that you have regular access to emails and can connect to meetings on Zoom. We can provide training if you need to learn how to use Word or Excel, for example. Please apply and we can talk about how we can help make sure you can participate fully. Can I become a trustee if I’m applying for asylum? We can only accept applications from people with leave to remain in the UK or UK citizenship. We would be happy to consider an application from you to become a trustee when we next recruit if you have secured leave to remain by then.

Rainbow Migration,Why Trans Day of Visibility is so important,31-Mar-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/why-trans-day-of-visibility-is-so-important/,"Sasha Taylor, from Guatemala, went through the asylum system in the UK a few years ago. She has kindly shared her thoughts on how the asylum system could be improved and why it is so important to celebrate Trans Day of Visibility. What would you like to see changed in the current UK asylum system to make it more inclusive of trans people? Firstly, the waiting time to give us an answer to our asylum application. I waited more than two years to receive an answer, which made my depression, anxiety and post trauma disorder so much worse. I received counselling, group therapy, and NHS medication. Lots of people don’t get even that support. I have been able to manage my mental health, and now have a healthy life. I am very grateful for that, but there are still moments when my mental health suffers. This means it can take longer to re-integrate into society and improve ourselves personally and professionally. We need to be good to ourselves, and stay positive, so we can look forward and move on. Second, trans people seeking asylum need access to education. For example, English classes will help people seeking asylum integrate into society. It’s important to note that 99% of LGBT refugees, especially trans people, do not have access to education. They face discrimination because of their gender identity, and lack opportunities, economical resources or official Identification to make the most of educational resources. It took me one year and six months for a school to accept me so I could study English language, and I had to ask for the intervention of a social worker to help me get a place. It is important to understand that learning the language of the country helps you develop your confidence and integration in the society; it opens doors to a better life. Third, we need more access to support workers. They inform us so much, and teach us about our rights and obligations in this country. I was able to have one, because of my type of case, but I know many people do not receive that support and they don’t know anything about those topics. It is necessary to recognise our own human rights, but they also go hand in hand with our obligations and responsibilities too, and that makes us all be a better citizen. It is really important to engage with that because it makes us all more tolerant, and we can move forward together as a society. It can help show politicians that we are human beings, rational and intelligent, that we are not ignorant, or animals that they can move or send from one place to another. Politicians, and society, need more empathy and sensitivity. Why do you think it is important to celebrate Trans Day of Visibility? In many countries, lots of LGBT people are murdered each year. This is especially true for trans people, as they often have a more visible identity. They are particularly subject to violence, attacks and murders. Trans Day of Visibility is so important, but we need more than a one-day celebration. It is an opportunity for politicians, society, and the world in general, to know that trans people are human beings like any other, 365 days a year. We have physical, intellectual and emotional capacities like anyone else. If we are given the right tools to live our lives, and the necessary protection of our human rights, we can be part of this society, and we can develop and move forward with equality, respect, and peace. That’s why it is necessary for politicians to make new legislation, and adapt the laws, so there is justice, inclusion, tolerance and respect for all. It would create a healthier, safer, more inclusive, and humane social environment for all of us, and future generations of trans people, in this country and anywhere in the world.

Rainbow Migration,What does a Support Worker at Rainbow Migration do?,17-Mar-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/what-does-a-support-worker-at-rainbow-migration-do/,"Our team of Support Workersprovideemotional and practical support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and intersex people, who are going through the UK asylum and immigration system.We spoke to one of them,Stuart, who explainedwhat Support Workers do, and why their work is so important. What kind of issues are LGBTQI+ people in the asylum system specifically facing? LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum face particular risks. One of the biggest issues is living conditions. LGBTQI+ people are often housed in inappropriate accommodation, with people who are LGBTQI-phobic. LGBTQI+ people also must ‘prove’ their sexual orientation and gender identity for their asylum application, but this can be very challenging. LGBTQI+ people are sometimes disbelieved by the Home Office, which often wants straightforward, traditional stories of “coming out”, but most of our service users have had to live secret lives as they are fleeing dangerous and homophobic societies. Or the Home Office might expect our service users to provide very specific evidence, such as being in a relationship. They are often isolated which means they aren’t part of an organisation and don’t have LGBTQI+ friends. Often, they are fleeing persecution in their home country, and come to the UK seeking safety. As they have often had to hide their sexual orientation and gender identity, it can be very difficult for them to provide any evidence they are LGBTQI+. They might also need to avoid other people from their country, because they might be at risk of facing the LGBTQI-phobic abuse they are fleeing. This means that LGBTQI+ people in the asylum system in the UK need specific support and safeguarding throughout the asylum process, which we aim to provide for them. What does a Support Worker at Rainbow Migration do? Primarily, we provide one-on-one emotional support. We also have men’s, women’s and trans support groups. We meet, in person, twice a month. This is an opportunity for our service users to meet other people in similar situations, and to share our good or bad news with each other. It’s a way of building a support network, and it’s a really important part of our service. Generally, our service users are very isolated. The pandemic made that worse. We are here to talk to them. They are often new to the UK and don’t know many people. Often, they keep their sexual orientation, gender identity, and their asylum status to themselves. Many are used to having to hide who they are, having faced a lot of stigma both in their home countries and here in the UK. They are often traumatised and may find it difficult to talk to strangers in a Home Office interview. We help them deal with what can be very stressful situations. We help our service users access safe housing and healthcare. We talk to them about mental health, and if we need to, find them a therapist or counsellor, or make sure they have access to the right medication. Sometimes we cover their costs for healthcare, or essential purchases such as hygiene products or food. We also have a legal team to guide them through the asylum process, and they help them find legal representation. We refer our service users to legal aid solicitors, or for pro-bono advice. We also have monthly partnership sessions, where pro-bono solicitors offer free advice to LGBTQI+ couples who need support when one or both partners need a visa to stay in the UK, as the process for couples is different. All our services are free, confidential, and available before and during their asylum claim.  What does a typical day for a Support Worker look like? I book calls and have catchups with service users. Most of my service users don’t have many people to talk to, so it’s important I can be there for them. Sometimes I have emergencies, such as someone being made homeless, or someone urgently needing a solicitor. Many of my service users feel very low and are having mental health crises; so, I take lots of time each day to be as much of a support to them as possible. This can be in person, over the phone, or by email. Many feel unheard, invisible, ignored, helpless. I am here to listen and help as much as I can. Every two weeks I run the men’s support group. We meet in person, and at the moment we have about 15 men in the group. It is a safe space, for our service users to share their stories, listen to each other, and be themselves without judgement. What is the asylum process like? It can take years to claim asylum. Some of our service users wait as long as five years to hear a decision. Many wait two years just for the interview. They just don’t know when they’ll hear. There’s no pattern, it’s not like the Home Office is working through an organised waiting list. It’s impossible to say when people will hear about their case. Their lives are on hold. It’s a very long, frustrating waiting game. Whilst they’re waiting, they’re trying to live on £40 a week. It’s almost impossible. After a year you can apply to work but only for specific jobs such as care, but many of our service users are not in a situation to provide care for others. Many of them are facing their own mental health issues. Most of them need too much support to then be supporters and carers themselves. How could the system be improved? People seeking asylum should be able to work, have access to better housing, and have a choice about where to live. There should be more LGBTQI+ accommodation, such as the ones that Micro Rainbow already provides. Trans people seeking asylum are especially at risk.  LGBTQI+ people should be able to live and work safely. The process is so expensive, yet also so slow. The application system needs a time limit; people should be guaranteed an interview and a decision by a certain time. It’s so cruel to keep people waiting, in poverty, for years. The fact that the system is getting even slower since the pandemic is ridiculous. LGBTQI+ people in immigration detention are not safe. They shouldn’t detain anyone; the use of indefinite immigration detention is inhumane. At the moment, people can be detained in these centres for months and even years. Their lives are in total limbo. The system is terrible for everyone, but it especially harms LGBTQI+ people. Those seeking asylum should be able to work. Instead they are housed in Home Office accommodation, with nothing to do; the current system costs a huge amount, and no-one in this country benefits, financially, or otherwise. We need a massive change in the way the media reports asylum; we need to change public opinion around it. We need a change in the asylum system. The whole process is broken.  What is the best thing about your job? Well, my job shouldn’t exist. If we had a better, more humane system, my role wouldn’t be necessary! But as it is, I do the best I can. What I will say is that I have the most amazing team and support network around me. My colleagues are fantastic, and I couldn’t do this job without them.

Rainbow Migration,Government’s new asylum bill fails to consider the safety of LGBTQI+ people seeking safety here,15-Mar-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/governments-new-asylum-bill-fails-to-consider-the-safety-of-lgbtqi-people-seeking-safety-here/,"Last week, the government announced yet another cruelasylum billthat punishes people seeking to rebuild their lives in the UK. Among other things, the bill proposes to send people who have fled life-threatening situations in their home countries, and sought safety and protection from the UK, toa list of countries(page 64) that includescountries that are not safe for LGBTQI+ people. For instance, Ghana is set as one of the countries that is deemed to be safe for men, however as recently as December 2022,Adams, a bisexual man from Ghana that we supported was granted asylum in the UK. He told us that “generally society [in Ghana] is very homophobic, including much of my family, who wanted me to change. I was violently attacked in the street on several occasions, and I knew it wasn’t safe for me stay in Ghana as an openly bisexual man”. Another country deemed safe to send men seeking safety in the UK is Nigeria. However, in 2021 government statistics show that up to 50 people were granted asylum on the grounds of their sexual orientation (no gender breakdown is provided). Last year,Joel, a gay activist from Nigeria, describedhow a law passed in 2014 “prohibits same-sex marriage and ruthlessly punishes LGBT+ people in Nigeria. In addition to prohibiting same-sex marriage, the law legitimised oppression and was used by authorities to justify persecution”, and added that “citizens can carry out ‘jungle justice’ without repercussions; lynching and murder of LGBT+ people is a common occurrence”. Rwanda is among the countries in the list as well, whichwe have repeatedly called outas a country where LGBTQI+ people are subjected to discrimination, violence and abuse. The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Rwanda is so poor that it is a source country for people seeking asylum in the UK based on their sexual orientation, albeit in low numbers, and Rainbow Migration has previously provided support to LGBTQI+ people from Rwanda. Innocent Uwimana, a gay man from Rwanda,has writtenabout how dangerous it is for LGBTQI+ people there and urged the government to ditch the proposal.  Increased risk of immigration detention The new bill also greatly extends the powers to hold people in immigration detention, whilst simultaneously restricting their ability to challenge this. This will result in a vast increase in the number of people who could be locked away, which will include LGBTQI+ people, who we know are at additional risk of harm in detention centres. Leila Zadeh, Executive Director at Rainbow Migration said: “By introducing this heartless and cruel bill, this government is sending a message that it doesn’t care about the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQI+ people seeking protection here. We have already received calls from LGBTQI+ people expressing distress about the potential impact of the bill on their lives, telling us they feel ‘unwelcome’ here”. We are urging this government to stop this inhumane and dangerous bill immediately and instead focus on creating a compassionate and caring asylum system that treats people with kindness.

Rainbow Migration,LGBTQI+ people still at serious risk of harm in immigration detention,08-Feb-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/lgbtqi-people-still-at-serious-risk-of-harm-in-immigration-detention/,"A new pilot study into LGBTQI+ experiences of immigration detention since September 2016 indicates that LGBTQI+ people continue to face harassment, bullying and deteriorating mental health while in immigration detention. The study, conducted by Dr Laura Harvey at the University of Brighton and supported by Rainbow Migration, looks at the experiences in detention of five members of the LGBTQI+ community – three gay men and two non-binary people. Four of the participants were held in Immigration Removal Centres for several months, and one in a Short-Term Holding Facility for 48 hours.  Key findings – LGBTQI+ people not safe in immigration detention Participants in the research experienced verbal and physical homophobic abuse from other people held in detention, including from individuals they were forced to share locked rooms with at night. Usman* described how he reported someone who“spat on my face for being a gay”, but was still made to share a room with this person until they attacked him physically. As a result of this violence and intimidation, participants feared being ‘out’ while in detention and felt a need to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. However, they were not always able to do this despite trying to, so they remained exposed to the risk of bullying and abuse. Johnson* said:“I don’t want to hide my sexuality here but I didn’t tell anyone because I was so scared.” Although some participants found staff to be a source of help and support, others reported problems including verbal homophobic abuse from staff, being afraid to report homophobic bullying to staff, inaction from staff in the face of escalating homophobic bullying and misgendering by staff. Overall, participants experienced worsening mental health and delayed access to mental health support while in detention, as well as being put in situations that resembled past traumatic experiences. Johnson* had suffered violent homophobic attacks in their home country – including one in which their partner was killed – and was identified by a GP in detention as needing mental health support. However they waited three months to be seen by a psychiatrist, during which time they had to share a locked room with someone who was openly homophobic towards them.  Ending LGBTQI+ detention remains as urgent as ever The research aimed to explore whether experiences of LGBTQI+ people in detention had changed significantly since thelast piece of researchon this topic in 2016 and after the introduction of theAdults at Risk in Immigration Detention policythat same year, which recognised the heightened risk of harm to trans and intersex people in detention. According to the findings, LGBTQI+ people still face considerable and ongoing risk of harm in immigration detention in the UK. The data suggest that detention centres are inherently risky for LGBTQI+ people, who are trapped in a space that they cannot leave, in which abuse and harassment are difficult to escape. With the government nowincreasing its use of immigration detentionit is crucial they recognise thatpeople who cannot be kept safe from harm in detention should never be placed there. That applies to all members of the LGBTQI+ community. If you agree pleaseemail your MPto ask if they oppose LGBTQI+ detention and let us know their response. * All names used for participants are pseudonyms to protect their anonymity.

Rainbow Migration,“It is a way of getting my voice heard in cases where it normally wouldn’t be heard”,06-Feb-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/it-is-a-way-of-getting-my-voice-heard-in-cases-where-it-normally-wouldnt-be-heard/,"We work with a ‘Campaigns Advisory Group’ made up of LGBTQI+ people with lived experience of the UK asylum system to steer our public campaigning. The group meets regularly with staff to plan, deliver and evaluate activities for ourNo Pride In Detention campaign. Vanessa, one of the current members, told us her thoughts on being part of this group. “I came across the advisory role from a friend who knows how passionate I am about the rights of LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum and refugees. At first I was hesitant because I am a bit anxious but I went for it. I remember the interview with Emma and Carla, it was very informal and I was literally on a coach to Manchester. Talking to Emma about my expected commitment got me very excited and I looked forward to joining the advisory team. I remember receiving the email that I was successful and feeling hopeful for the future and participating in influencing decisions. It has been a very good experience, I have learnt so much about the refugee system, apart from experiencing the asylum system, from the research and reports that have been conducted I have walked in the shoes of others.” It is a way of getting my voice heard in cases where it normally wouldn’t be heard. The best part about this is being able to influence decisions, coming up with ideas for campaigns, participating in events. It is a way of getting my voice heard in cases where it normally wouldn’t be heard. I had heard about detention centres but never heard stories from LGBTQ+ people who had actually stayed in detention centres. Being in the advisory group has opened my eyes to the struggles and has also created the passion to lend my voice and words against detention. Imagine leaving a country that restricts your rights and freedom and then getting into a prison like environment, it can be devastating. So whether it is silently lending your voice, participating in campaigns and researches, if you are passionate about helping people then this is the right place.”  To learn more aboutRainbow Migration’sCampaigns Advisory Group and how you canget involved,pleasesee the role descriptionand application form.

Rainbow Migration,Travelling as a person with refugee status,23-Jan-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/travelling-as-a-person-with-refugee-status/,"Have you recently been granted refugee status? If so, this is probably a big moment for you and you will surely be feeling a sense of relief. There is quite a lot to sort out in your life and to help with that we havea guide that outlines how you can access housing, benefits, education, training and employment after you have been granted. But you might have some broader questions as well, like whether you can leave the country and whether it is safe for you to travel abroad particularly as an LGBTQI+ person. Our Trustee, Ucman Scher, is a former refugee and has travelled extensively to over 75 countries and blogs underBrownBoyTravels. He has kindly provided some information about his personal experiences of travelling after being granted refugee status. You can find more of Ucman’s travel tips and tricks on hisblog,Instagram,TikTokandYouTubechannel. **Before we proceed, please be awarethat this article is based on real life experience andshould not be taken aslegal advice.For all legal matters, please consult a lawyer or relevantprofessional.** What is refugee travel and why is it any different from non-refugee travel? Travelling as a person with refugee status is quite a different experience from regular travel because the rules that apply to air travel and crossing borders are different. A good example is theSchengen Area. While anyone else with a Schengen visa can travel freely within the zone, each country applies a different requirement for people with refugee status. Safety is also a concern as is the risk of losing your documentation abroad. Are people with refugee status allowed to travel? Yes and no. The most common misconception is that once you have refugee status you are supposed to stay in the same country, work, build your life and that’s pretty much it. I call it the guilt of pleasure. Just because you have been granted asylum status doesn’t mean you should deny yourself any pleasures of life, and travelling is one of the best of them. You can travel to broaden your horizons and gain new experiences. In my case it really helped me heal trauma. Learning about other cultures, and meeting new, kind people all over the world has helped me see  life from a different perspective. The only exception is travelling to your home country. This is a serious issue and your asylum can be revoked on return. More importantly you shouldn’t travel there since your life might be in  danger in your home country. What documentation do you need to travel as a person with refugee status? As part of your asylum application, the Home Office will have taken your national passport away. However you can apply for and travel with aRefugee travel documentthat the Home Office can issue. You will need someone to verify/certify the application. You should always keep yourBRPon you at all times, you need it to re-enter the country. I have a refugee travel document, should I book my tickets and get ready to fly now? Not quite yet! We still have some more preparation to do before that flight. If you receive benefits, you should check the conditions of your benefits before and if the travel is essential, you must notify the job centre and get permission from your benefits case handler to travel as an exception. The next big item on the to-do list is checking whether you require a visa to enter your chosen destination. What is the process of obtaining visas as a refugee? This is the most difficult part of your plans, and  the most annoying part of travelling. Like I mentioned before,  every single country in the EU and Schengen Area has different rules for people travelling with refugee status and you must check the embassy or consulate website for each country before you plan your travels. Finding out if and how you need a visa is also a little bit of a painful process, as you must go beyond the  British citizens’ page on the embassy or consulate website. For some countries, it will be quite clear.  Other times it will be quite ambiguous, and in some cases, there might not be any information. If this is the case, you can go to Ministry of Foreign Affairs website and look for the information there. If it is not available on their website, you will have to write to or call the embassy to find out the necessary information. I would also highly recommend keeping the embassy link or written communication with you when you go to the airport. For example, when I tried to visit Iceland there was an issue with my visa status. According to the Icelandic consulate in London, I did not need a visa, but the airline and the border agency of Iceland insisted that I did. I was not allowed into the plane and had to come back to London. I then waited for the consulate to open the next morning and got written permission to board the next flight, for a trip I had arranged for my birthday with my friends. All these problems slightly spoiled the occasion, but sadly this is the reality of travelling as a person with refugee status. Other practical tips: General safety tips: 1- Don’t tell anyone that you have refugee status unless you trust them completely. Romantic liaisons abroad shouldn’t fall into the trusted category, I’m afraid. 2-Keep your travel document and BRP safe at all times, I’d go as far as saying, keep it dearer than your life.It is the most important item whilst you are travelling.If you loseit,you will have to apply for a newvisa(notjust the refugee traveldocument) and doing so in a foreign land can be costly and quite a headache with all the paperwork and documentation. I would recommend keeping it inasafe andhavinga coloured copyof iton you at all times,toavoid taking it around with you. 3- You should also be aware that you are not a British Citizen and the British consulates do not offer protection topeople with refugee statusas such; in short you are on your own. Do not do anything illegal or get intoanytrouble, thiswould put you in a very vulnerable situation.The most common reasonpeople have issues abroad is becausetheyuse recreational drugs. Obey the law and be responsible and you’ll be perfectly fine. I have never had to contact a British embassy abroad sounfortunatelyI cannot tell you how long it would take to get your documentation in order or how helpful they are in case of legal trouble.If you have someexperience, please do reach outto mewith your experience, I’m always glad to hearother people’sexperiences. Is there any other advice you’d like to give? All of the information above might seem daunting but once you arrive at your destination, it will be worth it. Travelling will help you with so many things. I always say, Eat, travel and be merry!

Rainbow Migration,Less scrutiny means more risk for LGBTQI+ people in detention,18-Jan-23,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/less-scrutiny-means-more-risk-for-lgbtqi-people-in-detention/,"ThisGovernmenthas stopped commissioningtheannualindependentreviews into the treatment of vulnerable adultsinimmigrationdetention.If there is no onethat keeps an eye onthe conditionsin detention,LGBTQI+ people couldbe put at risk ofmoreharm. Last week, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI), David Neal, and the former Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Stephen Shaw CBE,reportedthat this Government was ending their annual independent investigations into the treatment of vulnerable adults in detention. What is the Adults at Risk policy and how long has it been independently reviewed? TheAdults at Risk policy(AaR) recognises that certain groups of people may be “particularly vulnerable to harm in detention” and creates a presumption that these groups should not be detained. The AaR includes trans and intersex people and our ‘No Pride in Detention’campaign is calling for lesbians, gay and bisexual people to also be included in this policy, as there is evidence that they also experience homophobic bullying, harassment and abuse when locked up. The ICIBI carries out reviews on the effectiveness of the Home Office’s practices and policies towards adults at risk in immigration detention since 2015 and makes recommendations to improve the conditions of detention. But as the ICIBInotes, “though many recommendations arising from our reviews and inspections have been accepted, progress in implementing them has been painfully slow”. For instance, in 2019, Inhis report on the Adults at Risk annual inspection, the ICIBI commented upon the fact that the Home Office does not collect data on the number of LGBTQI+ people who are detained, and therefore it was “hard to see how the Home Office is able to assess the quality of its decisions to detain or the impacts of detention on specific group”. This is a recommendation that has not been implemented yet. Latest ICIBI report released The news about the end of these reviews comes as the last annual report hasjust been released, in which the Inspectorate reports that “officers in both Yarl’s Wood and Harmondsworth [detention centres] told inspectors that being under-resourced and carrying vacancies was negatively affecting the delivery of their required engagement activity”, with delays of “up to a month”. The “engagement activity” includes inductions for new arrivals to detention, in which LGBTQI+ people have the opportunity to raise their sexual orientation and/or gender identity with officials. If people don’t have the opportunity to raise that they are LGBTQI+ when they enter the detention centre, it can be more difficult to raise this at a later stage, and people may not be made aware of policies that are in place to protect them from bullying, discrimination and abuse. With these inspections coming to an end, the Home Office will face less pressure to comply with the policy and improve conditions in detention for adults at risk, including LGBTQI+ people. The Governmenthas saidit plans to “take the welfare of detained individuals extremely seriously”, but at Rainbow Migration we find it hard to understand how they are going to achieve that while dismantling the independent scrutiny mechanisms in place. Immigration detention is not safe for anyone. Being detained puts many people who are often already traumatised, at even greater risk of poor mental health and suicide. This is especially true for LGBTQI+ people. Instead of trying to end the annual reviews on the adults at risk policy’s effectiveness, this Government should put an end to the detention of LGBTQI+ people and set a time limit on all immigration detention.

Egregious policies and legislation such as theRwanda dealand theNationality and Borders Act,which acutely affect LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum, have caused heightened fear and anxiety among our service users. Our support services and specialist legal advice service have been a lifeline for many, helping LGBTQI+ people seeking asylum to reduce isolation, build support networks and succeed in the asylum process.

Rainbow Migration,“I aspire to create a community that can champion kindness and caring”,14-Dec-22,https://www.rainbowmigration.org.uk/news/in-the-week-leading-up-to-international-migrants-day-18-december-we-celebrate-everyone-who-has-moved-across-international-borders-whether-by-choice-or-necessity/,"In the week leading up toInternational Migrants Day(18 December), we celebrate everyone who has moved across international borders, whether by choice or necessity. This yearwe have partnered up with IOM and IMIXto highlight the voice of Zarith, one of the people that we arecurrently supportingand a lived experience ambassador of theInternational Migrants Day Ambassador Programme. Zarithis a journalist, a poet, and a “wannabeastronaut”, as he describes himself. He came to the UK to start a new life, free from harm, and is currently awaiting a decision on whether this government will allow him to live in safety in the UK. If he is granted asylum, he hopes to continue his studies at University College London. He recentlytold Pink News: “We are people. We have lots to give. We want to add value to the country that we are in, and I’m really sad if the UK is going to [regress] in terms of human rights and protection for asylum seekers. That would be a really dark day for the UK.” Here is part of his blog: From a boy who runs around the village half- naked with my mum’s veil, while playing at serving ‘regal ’ afternoon tea to becoming a young scientist at 13, it has been a global soul searching for me to fit in somewhere I can safely and finally call my ‘home’. Born in a tropical island in Malaysia, a multicultural home set a deeply rooted, dynamic and diverse foundation that would carry me in various parts of the world. Not much interested in ‘manly ’sports in my younger days, romantic English literature from the likes of Jane Austen & William Wordsworth took me to faraway misty English countryside, often fantasising of my knight in shining armour. Thanks to my sister, she also introduced me to classical music, and I demanded to learn to play piano and master a few languages. As a chubby kid who loved a myriad of intercultural gastronomic delights, food has become central to one of my passions which is cooking. Having a beloved grandmother on my side who cooked almost every day, she lovingly hand-fed me simple, flavourful, home cooked meals. Having both of my parents who worked full time, my late grandmother was not only my source of inspiration but also the most altruistic soul who instilled in me bountiful gentleness, affection, empathy, and kindness to become the softhearted person that I am today. I could not thank her enough to be in my formative life to my mid teenage years. When she passed on, it was the biggest blow in my entire life as I felt as my wings had been clipped & my heart had been wrenched out of my ribcage. I remember reading her newspaper articles in her later years as she was unable to read due to her vision impairment, not knowing that I would become a journalist one day.

Women for Refugee Women,The Supreme Court ruled the Rwanda Plan unlawful,15-Nov-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/great-news-the-supreme-court-ruled-rwanda-plan-unlawful/,"On Wednesday 15th November the Supreme Court rejected the Government’s harmful Rwanda plan, and unanimously ruled that no-one seeking safety in the UK can be forcibly deported to Rwanda. The judgment is a resounding victory for all the organisations, individual claimants and legal professionals involved in the challenge, as well as everyone else who campaigned and took action. Our Director Alphonsine Kabagabo said: ‘The Supreme Court ruling sends a powerful message to the Government about just how inhumane, illegal and cruel their asylum policies are. We know how terrifying threats like the Rwanda plan are for the women in our network, who have survived serious violence and trauma, and need safety and stability in order to recover and rebuild their lives. We must continue to stand strong against the Government’s plans to ignore the Supreme Court’s judgment. When we stand together, in resistance, hope and compassion, we can challenge cruelty and create change. Let’s show the Government that their harmful policies do not represent us.’"
Women for Refugee Women,Suella Braverman’s speech: How it harms women and LGBTQ+ people,26-Sep-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/suella-bravermans-speech-how-it-harms-women-and-lgbtq-people/,"Suella Braverman’s speech: How it harms women and LGBTQ+ people We strongly condemn Suella Braverman’s speech today. The Refugee Convention, which was signed in 1951 following World War 2, makes no explicit mention of women or people who are LGBTQ+, but rightly, over time, the particular forms of persecution they face have been recognised by case law. Before these forms of persecution were recognised, women in our network like Anu who experienced extreme violence, rape and female genital mutilation, would not have been given refugee status – which could have had life or death consequences for her. Under Suella Braverman’s vision of the asylum system, this would happen again. Suella Braverman claimed today that ‘simply being gay or a woman and fearful of discrimination in your country of origin is sufficient to qualify for protection’ . As she well knows, this claim is false. To be granted asylum in the UK, you must prove well-founded fear of persecution. Braverman is deliberately spreading misinformation to whip up racism, hatred and fear about people seeking safety in order to score cheap political points. It is clear that she doesn’t care who she harms in the process of doing this. Her speech today is hypocritical. The Government have repeatedly stated its commitment to tackle violence against women and girls and support survivors of such. However, it seems this commitment doesn’t apply to women who are seeking asylum, who have experienced serious violence and trauma, including sexual exploitation, forced marriage, female genital mutilation and rape. Suella Braverman seeks to whip up hatred, division and fear. But we are better than this. We know that most people choose compassion and kindness. That we offer our hand to those in need of protection and welcome them into our communities. In the face of racism and hostility, we will continue to stand in solidarity with refugee and asylum-seeking women and support the women in our network to rebuild their lives in their UK. Our Director, Alphonsine Kabagabo, says: Suella Braverman’s speech today is dangerous. The Refugee Convention has rightly evolved since it was signed in 1951 following World War 2, to recognise the persecution of women and LGBTQ+ people. This expansion, which has happened via case law, is a good thing. It means that women and LGBTQ+ people are granted protection on the basis of gendered persecution, or on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. Braverman’s attempt to minimise the persecution suffered by women and LGBTQ+ people could have life or death consequences. The majority of women we support, including LGBTQ+ women, are survivors of persecution including gender-based abuse, sexual violence, rape and other torture. The Government may want to turn their backs on these women, but we never will. Instead of whipping up hate, fear and division, the Government should treat people seeking safety in the UK with compassion and kindness. How we treat people is who we are and Suella’s speech today sends a loud and clear message."
Women for Refugee Women,A huge congratulations to Agnes and Loraine for winning the Pioneer 20 award!,06-Sep-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/a-huge-congratulations-to-agnes-and-loraine-for-winning-the-pioneer-20-award/,"Women for Refugee Women are extremely proud to announce that Agnes Tanoh , our Spokesperson Facilitator, and Loraine Masiya Mponela , one of our trustees, have both won a Visa Everywhere Pioneer 20 award. The award spotlights trailblazing refugee women who excel in their respective fields and have a meaningful impact in their communities – and Agnes and Loraine certainly do! Agnes In her home country of Cote d’Ivorie, Agnes was a high-ranking member of a political party, and personal assistant to the First Lady – a career which she loved and excelled at. But when civil war broke out in 2010, she had to flee to save her life. Agnes waited 7 long years in the asylum system in the UK before receiving her refugee status, which included 3 months in immigration detention and experiencing homelessness. Despite all that she has been through, Agnes channels her experiences into a positive force – to make change for other women like her. Agnes says, ‘No-one chooses to be an asylum-seeker. I never thought it would happen to me. I suffered so much for no reason. I won’t let any other women suffer like me.’ Agnes now wears many hats. She is Spokesperson Facilitator at Women for Refugee Women in which she supports a group of refugee and asylum-seeking women to develop their knowledge and skills on how to speak out, advocate, and campaign for change. She volunteers at Women With Hope in Birmingham, a charity supporting destitute refugee and asylum-seeking women, and supports individual women through the gruelling asylum process. Agnes also campaigns tirelessly against the hostile asylum process and is a passionate and inspiring campaigner, regularly speaking at protests, to the local and national media, and to parliamentarians. She also started her own petition against Derwentside, the main detention centre for women in the UK, in County Durham, which now has over 17,000 signatures. Agnes has become a real pillar of her community and is often affectionately referred to as ‘Mama Agnes’. Agnes said: “I would like to express all my gratitude to Pioneer 20. Their awards recognise the value, the potential, the aptitudes that people seeking asylum have. It gives meaning to our existence in this country where the environment is increasingly hostile to those seeking safety, protection, security or simply a better life. I also want to say thank you to all the organizations who believed in me while I was seeking asylum, these are organisations like Hope Project, Women With Hope, and Baobab, who I volunteered for during my long wait for my refugee status, to give back to other people like me who are in the process of waiting for their status. I am particularly proud  of Women For Refugee Women, who believed in me and my abilities as a campaigner. I can speak for my sisters, and inform the public about the harsh reality for people seeking asylum. To the government, I want to say: We have skills, give us the opportunity to use them. We have a heart to give our love, our compassion and our support to all the people in our community.” Loraine Loraine, originally from Malawi, was studying in the UK at the University of Leeds, alongside working as a primary school teacher, when a change in her circumstances meant she had to claim asylum in the UK. Whilst waiting for her refugee status, which took several years, Loraine was not allowed to work, study, or access any mainstream welfare support. She existed on just over £5 per day for food, toiletries, clothing, travel, and other needs. Despite the difficulties that she has been through, Loraine has achieved, and continues to achieve so much as an inspiring leader, campaigner, and published poet! Loraine balances many roles and responsibilities. Loraine has been a trustee at Women for Refugee Women since 2020, bringing her wealth of knowledge and her experience of claiming asylum in the UK to the Board. Previously, she was the Chair of the grassroots organisation, CARAG, which is based in Coventry and supports individuals who are subjected to hostile immigration policies in the UK. Loraine is also a founding member and one of the spokespeople for the Status Now 4 All network, which campaigns for undocumented migrants and migrants in the UK to be granted leave to remain. Loraine now works as a Network Community Worker at Migrant Voice. Alongside her campaigning, Loraine writes poetry about the hostile environment, which has been published in several anthologies. Loraine said: “I am very excited and happy and full of gratitude to Visa and We Are The City for giving me and people like me who have felt voiceless the opportunity; the chance to voice our personal journeys and share it with the world at large. I am truly humbled.” Our Director, Alphonsine Kabagabo, said: I am delighted that my colleague Agnes and one of our trustees Loraine have been nominated to receive the Visa Everywhere Pioneer 20 award. Agnes and Loraine truly deserved the recognition, despite facing a lot of challenges  in their journey to seek protection in UK, they have remained positive and have made a huge and meaningful impact in their new communities. They are both, without a doubt, great roles models for many other women going through the same challenges, and I am so proud to work alongside and know them both! A huge congratulations to both incredible women. Their hard work, passion, resilience, and activism is an inspiration to us all!"
Women for Refugee Women,Passage of the ‘Illegal’ Migration Act,18-Jul-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/passage-of-the-illegal-migration-act/,"Joint civil society statement on the passage of the Illegal Migration Act, July 2023 As a coalition of 290 organisations representing the human rights, migrants’ rights, refugee and asylum, anti-trafficking, children’s, violence against women and girls, LGBTQI+, disability rights, health, LGBTQI+, housing, racial justice, criminal justice, arts, international development, environment, democracy, pan-equality, faith, access to justice, and other sectors, we condemn the passage of the Illegal Migration Act today, and stand in solidarity with all who will be affected. We all deserve to live safe from harm. But this senselessly cruel Act will have a devastating impact on people’s lives. It turns our country’s back on people seeking safety, blocking them from protection, support, and justice at a time they need it most. In abandoning the UK’s moral and legal obligations, the Act risks breaching multiple international human rights treaties including the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights while shielding the Government from accountability. The UK Government has admitted that it cannot confirm if the Act is compatible with the UK’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act will force people into situations that threaten their lives – whether by placing children in detention or sending people off to countries where their lives might be at grave risk. Moreover, the Act attacks the very core of human rights, which is the principle that we all have them regardless of who we are or where we are from. In stripping the most basic rights from people seeking safety and a better life, the Act dismantles human rights protections for all of us. Either all of us have human rights, or none of us do. While the UK Government’s plans will harm those seeking safety the most, this is an attack on all of us and the values we hold dear. The government has rushed through this law despite broad and deep opposition. But our fight is not over. As caring people, we will continue to fight for the right for people to seek safety and a better life without being forced to take dangerous journeys and without being punished for how they enter the UK. We will keep holding those in power to account for upholding the UK’s international obligations. We will strive for an asylum and immigration system that treats everyone with dignity and respect. We will stand in solidarity with and fight alongside everyone who makes the UK their home and build a society that treats everyone with compassion. Alphonsine Kabagabo, Director, Women for Refugee Women, says: I was lucky enough to receive protection when I needed it. I was welcomed and I was supported to rebuild my life. Now, under the ‘Illegal Migration Act’, women like me who are fleeing genocide, or war, rape, torture and trafficking will be prevented from seeking sanctuary here. This will undoubtedly place them at serious risk of further harm. Where is the compassion? Where is the humanity? Whilst we are extremely pleased that the Government has conceded to maintain the vital protection of the 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women, we remain appalled and outraged by the ‘Illegal’ Migration Bill and its abject cruelty. We remain staunch in our fight against these hostile policies and are hopeful that one day compassion will win over racism, cruelty and callousness. Today’s stranger is tomorrow’s friend.

Women for Refugee Women,Great news! The 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women is maintained,11-Jul-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/great-news-the-72-hour-time-limit-on-the-detention-of-pregnant-women-is-maintained/,"Following the resounding vote in the House of Lords last week, the Government has agreed to maintain the 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women. This small but vital amendment will protect pregnant women and their unborn babies from the harms of indefinite detention. We are extremely grateful to the Peers who have worked tirelessly to ensure that the time limit for pregnant women remains in place. In particular, Baroness Lister who tabled the amendment in the Lords, and Baroness Sugg, Baroness Gohir and the Bishop of Gloucester who supported it. We are also extremely grateful to our friends at Medical Justice, Birth Companions, The Royal College of Midwives, The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the British Medical Association and Maternity Action who have worked alongside us to preserve the time limit. We couldn’t have done this without their support and solidarity! Alphonsine Kabagabo, Director, Women for Refugee Women, says: Whilst we are extremely pleased that the Government has agreed to maintain the vital protection of the 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women, we remain appalled and outraged by the ‘Illegal’ Migration Bill and its abject cruelty. Under the Bill, women who have survived rape, torture and trafficking will be prevented from seeking sanctuary here, placing them at serious risk of further harm. We remain staunch in our fight against these hostile policies and hopeful that compassion will win over racism, cruelty and callousness."

Women for Refugee Women,Campaign win! All legal advice surgeries in immigration detention must now take place face-to-face.,13-Apr-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/campaign-win-legal-advice-detention/,"Following the legal challenge launched by Women for Refugee Women last year, on the lack of access to in-person legal advice for women locked up in Derwentside detention centre in County Durham, it has been announced that all legal advice surgeries in immigration detention must now take place face-to-face . This change came into force on Monday 3 rd April 2023, and marks an important and welcome recognition of the inadequacies of legal advice delivered by telephone or videocall in detention centres . We are extremely pleased that individuals who are detained will be able to receive face-to-face legal advice and meaningful access to justice. We launched our legal challenge in February 2022, shortly after Derwentside opened, and were represented by Toufique Hossain, Shalini Patel and Emma Dawson of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who instructed Alex Goodman and Miranda Butler of Landmark Chambers. SPM , a woman who was detained in Derwentside last year and struggled to access legal advice while there, was our co-claimant in the challenge. She is represented by Lily Parrott of Duncan Lewis Solicitors. Following a two-day hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in June 2022, our case was unfortunately not upheld. Just prior to this hearing, however, the Home Office announced it had secured in-person legal advice for Derwentside, to begin from July 2022. Recent figures indicate the majority of appointments taking place under the Detained Duty Advice Scheme (legal advice surgeries in detention) at Derwentside are now happening in person. Although half of legal advice appointments outside the Detained Duty Advice Scheme at Derwentside are still happening remotely, we hope this will improve soon. The importance of access to in-person legal advice also now appears to have been formally recognised by the Home Office and Legal Aid Agency , with the announcement that from 3rd April all legal advice surgeries in all immigration detention centres must take place face-to-face. Women for Refugee Women will continue to fight for Derwentside to be shut down, and for an end to all immigration detention. While anyone continues to be locked up in detention, however, access to face-to-face legal advice is essential to ensuring people’s cases are given a fair hearing and to allow meaningful access to justice. Alphonsine Kabagabo, Director of Women for Refugee Women, said: This about-turn by the Government on the issue of face-to-face legal advice shows that campaigning works. As the so-called ‘Illegal Migration Bill’ progresses through Parliament, we should take strength from this success and remember it is possible to stop the injustices and harms the Government wants to inflict. Love and compassion will always win over racism, callousness and cruelty. Shalini Patel, Public Law Solicitor at Duncan Lewis, said: This is a great win for the many women detained at Derwentside IRC. All along we have argued the importance and necessity for these vulnerable women to have access to face-to-face legal visits. The Home Office has essentially conceded, albeit this could have been avoided. There are potentially many women who did not have access to the legal advice they should have been entitled to and their cases may have been impacted by this. Recent figures indicate that the majority of Detained Duty Advice Scheme appointments at Derwentside are now taking place in person. We hope this is the first step to ensuring all legal advice appointments, including those outside of the Detained Duty Advice Scheme, happen face-to-face. We know that campaigning works. The ‘Illegal Migration Bill’, which is currently going through Parliament, will prevent people fleeing persecution who arrive in the UK by ‘irregular’ means (such as small boat) from claiming asylum here. Instead they will be locked up in detention indefinitely, while the Government attempts to remove them to their country of origin or a so-called ‘safe third country’, such as Rwanda. Women for Refugee Women is particularly concerned about proposals in the Bill to disapply the 72-hour time limit on pregnant women’s detention, introduced in 2016, and detain pregnant women who arrive ‘irregularly’ in the UK indefinitely. Please contact your MP to ask them to speak out against these proposals by clicking here . Although our challenge to the lack of in-person legal advice at Derwentside was not upheld by the High Court, SPM , our co-claimant, was granted permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal, on Ground 1, which focuses on access to justice. The appeal hearing is listed for May 2023."
Women for Refugee Women,Updated May 2023 – Joint briefing on the ‘Illegal Migration Bill’: Take action against the proposed new powers to detain pregnant women indefinitely,23-Mar-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/illegal-migration-bill/,"Women for Refugee Women, Birth Companions , British Medical Association , Royal College of Midwives , Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , Medical Justice and Maternity Action have prepared a joint briefing on the ‘Illegal Migration Bill’. Under the new ‘Illegal Migration Bill’, women fleeing persecution who arrive in the UK via ‘irregular’ means will be prevented from claiming asylum and detained indefinitely, with no exemption for those who are pregnant , removing the vital protection introduced by the 2016 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women. Being locked up and deprived of your liberty is distressing and harmful for anyone. For women who are pregnant, however, the impact of detention can be particularly acute: The Royal College of Midwives has said: ‘The detention of pregnant asylum seekers increases the likelihood of stress, which can risk the health of the unborn baby.’ In his 2016 review of the welfare of vulnerable people in immigration detention, Stephen Shaw explained: ‘That detention has an incontrovertibly deleterious effect on the health of pregnant women and their unborn children… I take to be a statement of the obvious.’ Healthcare in immigration detention if often very poor. The antenatal care and support provided to women who are detained has often fallen short of the care normally available to pregnant women. Research by Medical Justice found that in Yarl’s Wood, women often missed antenatal appointments; some women had no ultrasound scans while detained; and women did not have direct access to a midwife and could not request visits. We cannot go back to what was happening before 2016, when many pregnant women were being detained for weeks, and sometimes months on end, with no idea of when they would be released.

Women for Refugee Women,"See Us, Believe Us, Stand With Us",02-Mar-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/see-us-believe-us-stand-with-us/,"To mark International Women’s Day 2023, we are delighted to publish our first ever report on the particular experiences of lesbian and bisexual women seeking safety. The research was co-ordinated with peer researchers, Raolat and Olivia, from the Rainbow Sisters, our solidarity group for LGBTQ+ refugee and asylum-seeking women and non-binary individuals. The new report, See Us, Believe Us, Stand With Us: The experiences of lesbian and bisexual women seeking asylum in the UK , shows that lesbian and bisexual women who have sought asylum in the UK are subject to further struggle, fear and intimidation within the asylum process. Seeking asylum has never been easy for our Sisters. Through this research we’ve seen that our individual experiences of fear, intimidation and struggle are part of a wider pattern of hostility that LBT women and non-binary people seeking asylum are subjected to. Here in the UK, we face the triple discrimination of racism, sexism and homophobia. The Home Office routinely disbelieves our stories and denies us protection. Read the report here. Twenty-four lesbian and bisexual women who claimed asylum in the UK due to fear of persecution because of their sexual orientation took part in the research , who fled from Nigeria (8), Uganda (5), Cameroon (4), Pakistan (2), Kenya (2), Iraq (1), Senegal (1) and Ghana (1). Over 80% of women did not claim asylum within the first month of entering the UK, experiencing multiple, overlapping barriers to disclosure : 14 out of 18 women were unaware of their right to claim asylum on the basis of sexual orientation; 12 were too traumatised by past experiences; 7 feared reprisals or exclusion from diaspora communities; 6 needed time to fully understand and accept their sexual orientation before seeking protection. Women experienced a lack of quality legal aid : 3 women did not have legal representation at the time of their asylum interview; Only 13 women had legal aid lawyers, and not one woman described their support as ‘very good’ or ‘excellent’. Women were often disbelieved by the Home Office : 11 women were refused asylum. In 9 of these cases, the Home Office did not believe their sexual orientation; Of the 7 women who had a form of leave to remain at the time of participation, all had to make a successful fresh claim application before being correctly recognised as a refugee and given the protection they need. The Rainbow Sisters and Women for Refugee Women call on the Government to meaningfully engage with LGBTQ+ women about their experiences in order to create a safe and supportive asylum support; to ensure that decision-making is centred on belief and fairness; and to remove changes introduced by the Nationality and Borders Act and new proposed legislation, the Illegal Migration Bill (7th March 2023), that will cause further harm and risk wrongful refusals of protection. Members of Rainbow Sisters share their hopes and wishes for change: The Home Office should believe our claims instead of treating us as liars. It takes so much to actually open up to someone about your fears. We need more people in the Home Office who understand us, staff who have knowledge about the countries we come from and our cultures. Think about our mental health. Read the report here. Click to tweet your MP to ask them to read our report and attend our parliamentary event – it takes 30 seconds! Alphonsine Kabagabo, Director, Women for Refugee Women, says: For years, Women for Refugee Women has been a home to the Rainbow Sisters – a solidarity group for LGBTQ+ women who are seeking safety in the UK. Because of their sexuality or gender identity, they’ve faced numerous hurdles to navigating the already complex and hostile asylum system. I hope that this research helps to raise awareness of their particular experiences and leads to the much-needed change so that they can live safely and freely in the UK. Priscilla Dudhia, Campaigns and Advocacy Manager and author of the research, at Women for Refugee Women, says: This report highlights the serious hurdles faced by lesbian and bisexual women seeking asylum, many of whom escape to the UK after suffering both gender-based and homophobic abuse. The findings provide yet more evidence of the urgent need for an asylum system that supports women to share their stories and treats those stories with belief.  However, less than a year since the Nationality and Borders Act became law, we are so far off from that vision, with more draconian, anti-refugee legislation being proposed by the Government just yesterday. The changes introduced by both the NAB Act and the new bill will only strengthen the culture of disbelief. What more evidence do we need of this culture before our politicians decide that enough is enough? Women like ‘Anu’ and Augusta deserve safety and a shot at rebuilding their lives . Nikki Ray, Rainbow Sisters Coordinator, Women for Refugee Women says: I am so proud that today on International Women’s Day we are highlighting the experiences of lesbian and bisexual (LB) asylum seeking women whose stories are so seldom heard. Many LB women who come to the UK seeking asylum have fled homophobic persecution and gender-based violence. Yet instead of finding safety in the UK, are met with a culture of disbelief from the Home Office and forced to “prove” their sexual orientation. This research exposes the triple discrimination of homophobia, sexism and racism which LB women experience in the UK asylum system. Contributors to the report are members of Rainbow Sisters, a solidarity group and essential safe and supportive space for lesbian, bisexual and trans (LBT) refugee and asylum-seeking women, where they can truly be themselves. It is so important that the voices and experiences of the Rainbow Sisters are heard to instigate much needed change in the asylum system which is currently failing and retraumatizing LBT women.

Women for Refugee Women,Welcome Every Woman: A Festive Celebration,08-Dec-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/welcome-every-woman-a-festive-celebration/,"Last night we held a celebratory event at our grassroots activities space, featuring powerful poetry performances from members of our drama group, who told us how we can Welcome Every Woman. Performances included important poetry and songs about women’s experiences of seeking safety in the UK: atrocious asylum accommodation, inhumane immigration detention centres and cruel decision-making. ‘418’ by Mahide: https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/418.mp4 ‘I say yes’ by EE: https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EE-1.mp4 We also laughed (particularly in Drama’s heads or tails game!), listened to music and ate delicious Iranian-inspired canapes made by Elahe, a member of our network and a talented chef. It was such a joyful and fun evening, where supporters came together with our staff, trustees, volunteers and drama group to celebrate refugee women. Coming together in celebration is vital in the face of the government’s hostility towards people seeking safety. Joy is resistance, and last night we had it in abundance! Our work with women seeking safety would not be possible without the compassion and solidarity of people like you. Thank you for all that you do.

Women for Refugee Women,Hiba’s Story: Pride 2023,29-Jun-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/hibas-story/,"This is Hiba’s story. “For as long as I can remember, I felt trapped in the wrong body.” Hiba grew up in a loving family in Pakistan, and always felt care and support from her mother and brother who gave her space to be who she is, to express herself and to live freely. Yet the extreme social stigma and harsh anti- LGBTQ+ laws in Pakistan made life incredibly difficult for Hiba, even from a very young age. She still remembers the first time she experienced persecution and violence at age 5, which was just the first of countless incidences of violence she encountered for being a transwoman, both in her home country of Pakistan and once she’d reached what she thought would be safety in the UK. “I was standing in line at mosque and didn’t know what to do. So, I joined the girls and sat down, hoping to be accepted. Then I felt a hard thud in my back, before being dragged away by my hair and beaten.” Hiba’s teenage years only became more difficult with Hiba attending over 20 schools in total in order to complete her education. Despite this, Hiba was enveloped in safety, love and protection by her mother and brother and enjoyed a happy childhood in the privacy of her home. In 2016, as an adult, Hiba finally received the diagnosis she had known all along. She had gender dysphoria and was able to start hormone treatment. Despite societal pressures, her brother’s support for her never dwindled: By this time, Hiba had established a successful career in filmmaking and producing in Pakistan, a job she loved and excelled at, but which would put her at further risk of abuse. Those in positions of power in Pakistan disliked both the LGBTQ+ community and journalists and the media – making Hiba a prime target. When her employer discovered she was trans, they were extremely angry. It wasn’t long before she started to receive anonymous threats detailing how they have appointed someone to shoot and kill her, before losing her job entirely. The threats escalated rapidly, including targeting Hiba’s family, and at age 34, her brother was brutally murdered for protecting her. To this day, the authorities have failed to investigate, citing his death as a mere ‘accident’. For Hiba, this is the moment she lost everything – “My best buddy, my lifeline, my protection – gone.” Hiba was forced into hiding, knowing she was no longer safe to live in her home that she had shared with her brother. She lived in hiding for some time, moving often and sofa-surfing with friends to avoid the authorities, but the threats continued to arrive no matter how often she moved or changed her number. Soon after Hiba lost her brother, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. Despite desperate pleas to hospitals and medical professionals, her mother was often refused treatment for supporting her daughter. Hiba was unable to visit her mother, often receiving threats saying the hospital was being watched and she would be killed if she tried to visit. Sadly, Hiba’s mother passed away without Hiba by her side to say goodbye. It was then she knew she had to leave Pakistan – “I had nobody left, I had to leave before I was killed” Hiba arrived in the UK in 2021, believing that the UK would be a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community like her. She had spent her school years reading about the United Kingdom and dreaming of living in a society in which people are free to be themselves and to live with happiness, dignity and safety. Arriving in the UK was a relief, even though she arrived with just the clothes she was wearing and no idea of where to go or what to do. But she was safe, far from those wanting to kill her. However, the weight of her grief, continued fear and depression took its toll. Hiba was diagnosed with PTSD and spent some time in hospital to recover. It has been almost two years since Hiba first claimed asylum in the UK and she is still waiting for her substantial interview. During this time, Hiba has been homeless due to miscommunication between the Home Office and the accommodation provider. Despite being forced onto the streets and the stress caused, Hiba was simply told ‘you can have access to your room now’ once the miscommunication was resolved. Hiba has also suffered abuse and bullying from staff in Home Office accommodation because of her gender identity, including persistent and intentional misgendering. On one occasion, a male member of staff entered her room without knocking whilst she was asleep in bed and started making fun of her for being a trans-woman. Despite the ongoing challenges Hiba faces whilst she is waiting for her claim to be decided, she isn’t letting this hold her back. She is creating a community for herself. One of these is at Women for Refugee Women’s Rainbow Sisters – a solidarity group for lesbian, bisexual and trans-women and non-binary people seeking asylum – “I have found a home. Rainbow Sisters is a healing space for me, it helps improve my confidence and my skills. I am with my people.” When asked her dreams for the future, Hiba simply says: “I just want to be a normal human being. I want freedom of life. I want to belong, just like everybody else.”"
Women for Refugee Women,Ange’s Story: Pride 2023,29-Jun-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/anges-story/,"This is Ange’s story. Growing up in Cameroon where same-sex activity is illegal and punishable with prison sentences, or worse, Ange found it extremely difficult to understand, accept and celebrate who she is. But being lesbian is not a choice. It is who Ange is. Once Ange came out and told her family she is lesbian, she was immediately cut off and still to this day does not have any contact with them. Fearing for her safety, and unable to live her life authentically, Ange claimed asylum in the UK. However, she is still waiting for her asylum interview, after two and a half years. “The waiting and waiting is so stressful. I cannot be free. I am cut off from all opportunities to grow, learn and better myself.” Ange has repeatedly felt pressure from people to ‘prove’ who she is, including suggestions that she should find a partner to prove that she is lesbian. Unfortunately, this is all too common. Our Rainbow Sisters research report, See Us, Believe Us, Stand With Us, found that disbelief and high-levels of ‘proof’ are all too commonplace in the asylum process for people from the LGBTQ+ community. Despite the difficulties of claiming asylum, Ange has found joy too. “The Rainbow Sisters are my family. We’re all so different, but we all help each other. It is solidarity in action. It is happiness.” Being part of Rainbow Sisters gave Ange the courage to be open about who she is, and for the first time ever, in 2022, Ange attended Pride. “I didn’t even know what Pride was! I felt like I was at Disneyland. It was liberating, I felt proud of who I am and proud of being lesbian! If people don’t like that I am lesbian, that is no longer a problem to me – it is their problem. I am not afraid; I am not shy. I am me!” Ange is looking forward to marching in the official London Pride parade this year, on Saturday July 1 st , alongside her Rainbow Sisters. “This year, I’m going to enjoy every moment!” Ange would like to tell others:"
Women for Refugee Women,A Collaboration between Women for Refugee Women and The Five Points Brewing Co.,04-May-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/a-collaboration-between-women-for-refugee-women-and-the-five-points-brewing-co/,"Cheers! A Collaboration between Women for Refugee Women and The Five Points Brewing Co. At Wit’s End: how we feel about the treatment of refugee women in the UK by the Home Office and also the name of The Five Points Brewing Co.’s new beer, brewed in collaboration with us for International Women’s Day! Our Head of Campaigns, Sophie Radice joined a team of Five Points Brewery Co.’s incredible women Brewster’s to make a delicious, summery beer with notes of elderflower, lemon and orange peel, and coriander. Yes, you heard it – you can now support our work by drinking beer! Photos by: Brody Rossiter. In celebration of this partnership, we came together at the The Five Points Taproom in Hackney for a night of poetry and beer tasting! Trish, Olivia and Maria from our drama group performed extremely powerful poems on hope, love, and their experiences seeking safety in the UK, some of which you can read below. Rhona McKeran from The Five Points Brewing Co. said that the purpose of this beer was: “…to shine a light on and support great women doing incredibly important work. “The beer’s name – At Wits’ End – represents the fear and desperation asylum-seeking women must endure when fleeing their homes, while the colour and the profile of the beer signifies hope for a positive future.” Women for Refugee Women’s Communications Manager, Carenza Arnold said: “We’re delighted to collaborate with Five Points Brewery on their special edition beer, At Wits’ End, to mark International Women’s Day 2023. We support women who are seeking safety in the UK from persecution, war, rape, gender-based violence and other torture, to rebuild their lives and advocate for change. At a time where there is increasing hostility towards people seeking safety, we’re extremely grateful for this collaboration which will shine a light on our work and what it means to be a refugee woman.” At Wits’ End will be available to purchase through The Five Points Brewing Co. by trade customers from Monday 24th April, with £10 from every keg sold donated to Women for Refugee Women. W e are so grateful to The Five Points Brewing Co. for their support. It will make a real difference to the women in our network, at time when refugee rights are increasingly under threat in the UK.

Women for Refugee Women,Guest blog: Our Mothers Ourselves,20-Mar-23,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/guest-blog-our-mothers-ourselves/,"Our Mothers Ourselves – Six women from across the world tell their mothers’ stories Cathy Hull, Rupal Shah, Kumi Konno, Caryn Solomon, Veena Siddharth, Vayu Naidu We are a group of six women who came together during the COVID-19 pandemic, from diﬀerent parts of the world  – Japan, Costa Rica and Britain -with the intent of exploring our mothers’ stories and writing together. Meeting one another virtually during that strange, isolated time, we shared our professional experience as writers, editors, teachers and readers and created a supportive space within which to critique and develop our writing and to start to uncover our mothers’ stories. Our book tells the stories of, ‘ordinary women’, who each in her own way was extraordinary and heroic, who taught their daughters how to live. Their stories span four continents and were shaped by some of the major events of the twentieth century, including World War, Colonialism and Apartheid in South Africa. Sharing our own stories of growing up, we realized that although we thought we understood our mothers’ lives, we didn’t know enough. We wanted to hear what our mothers had never told us and to explore what they handed down. Reflecting the diﬀerent time, place, class, social context and cultures in which our mothers lived out their lives, these stories speak of western, individualistic ideas of mothering as well as eastern, mythological understandings of the ‘universal mother’ embodied in us all. Despite their differences, the women described in this anthology share an ‘essence’ – they all dared to be diﬀerent. Cathy’s mother escaped her restricted family background in northern England, to forge a new life for herself in the South. Kumi’s mother moved to the southernmost part of the mainland to live with adoptive parents and later went to Tokyo to study at university. Vayu’s mother was among the first generation of Indian women to have access to higher education, subsequently mobilising the supply of milk to soldiers and refugee wives and children. Caryn’s mother’s involvement in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa put her own life at risk as well as the lives of her family. Through colonial ties between India and the UK, Rupal’s mother took the unprecedented step of migrating to London to marry a man she hadn’t seen for five years. Veena’s mother left India as a single woman, hoping that her medical qualifications would allow her to live an independent life in America. Four of our mothers were still alive during the creation of the book and were involved in the writing, providing private photographs, letters and diaries, as well as giving lengthy interviews. Two of our mothers were already dead when we started to write and in the case of one, for over fifty years. She left behind just a handful of photographs. Among common themes that emerged, the theme of migration stands out – our mothers’ migrations through countries and cultures, our personal migrations to deeper understandings of our mothers, our collective migration as writers towards a greater awareness of what binds us to each other and to our mothers. We believe these stories are not ours or our mothers’ alone. They are stories of all women in the world, stories of yearning for more, of courage to embrace but not to forget, of holding on, of letting go and of going back, of weathering the distance and of passing it all on. Inspired by our mothers, we will commit all profits of this book to Women for Refugee Women, which empowers refugee and asylum seeking women in the UK to tell their own stories and make their voices heard.

Women for Refugee Women,We held our first in-person Christmas party since 2019,15-Dec-22,https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/christmas-party-2022/,"On Friday 9th December, Women for Refugee Women held its first annual in-person Christmas party since 2019! It was an occasion for the refugee and asylum-seeking women in our network to come together , share their work from this term and celebrate the end of the year. There were performances from the drama group, poetry readings , a hot meal prepared by Elahe and lots of singing and dancing! T he drama groups shared several performances they have work ed on this term in their weekly Friday afternoon sessions at the Southbank Centre , includ ing an or iginal performance that was written, directed and performed collectively by all members of the group , consist ing of a chorus of statements of affirmation, power and dignity as a way of challenging the ‘ hostile environment ’ . “I am strong! I am powerful! I am formidable! I am a kind mother! I am unstoppable!” Next, was a beautifully delivered and choreographed group performance of Maya Angelou’s poem ‘ Phenomenal Woman ’ followed by a performance by Chichi Coco of a song she had written and composed herself. To close, several members of the group performed dances from different cultures that included Salsa and traditional Afghan and Turkish dances. After, our trustee Loraine Mponela shared poetry from her debut collection ‘I Was Not Born a Sad Poet ’ (2022) , including the titular poem ‘I Was Not Born a Sad Poet’ . P ublished earlier this year , the collection reflects on Loraine’s experiences navigating the UK asylum system. The performances and readings were followed by a delicious hot meal prepared by Elahe, a refugee woman from our network. It was wonderful to  catch up and chat with each other over a Christmas meal, followed by more singing and dancing! Thanks to the generosity and kindness of our supporters, each woman went home with a gift bag, including a £25 gift voucher, a selection of beauty products and toiletries, and a handwritten Christmas card. With the onset of the winter cold and darkness, this time of year is especially harsh for refugee and asylum-seeking women, made even more difficult this year by the cost of living crisis. Our Christmas party was an important moment for the women in our network to come together to celebrate the end of the year with their friends. We owe our thanks to our community of dedicated supporters, without whom the party and our work more broadly would be impossible. Thank you again!

Refugee Survival Trust,Extending free bus travel for people seeking asylum in Glasgow,06-Mar-23,https://www.rst.org.uk/archives/4359,"Refugee Survival Trust in partnership with five community organisations are commencing a scheme to provide free bus travel to people seeking asylum living in Glasgow through the provision of a 12-week digital First Bus pass, along with information and digital support to access and use the pass. This work is being funded by a grant from the Paths for All Smarter Choices Smarter Places Open Fund and will run until summer 2023. It will extend the work undertaken by Refugee Survival Trust and third sector partners in previous years to improve access to bus travel for refugees and people in the asylum system and will help a further 150 people in Glasgow. Participants in the project will be asked to provide information on how often they make use of bus travel and the reasons that journeys are made. They will feedback on how having access to bus travel positively impacts their lives. One participant commented Im very excited . I dont have the right to work so paying for a bus ticket, which costs 5.00, out of my 45 weekly stipend is a straight choice between eating and travelling.  I will no longer have to pass on educational activities, community engagements and appointments with solicitors and the doctor. My friends live 3 bus rides from me on the other side of Glasgow, a bus pass will mean no more involuntary isolation, which in my case, brought on depression. Minister for Transport Jenny Gilruth said: Im pleased that Scottish Government funding is supporting this free bus travel pilot in Glasgow. Around 150 people seeking asylum in Glasgow will benefit from free bus travel through a 12-week bus pass. The information gathered from this pilot will help inform options on how to deliver our Programme for Government commitment  to consider how best to provide free bus travel to people seeking asylum, right across Scotland. Im grateful to the Refugee Survival Trust and selected partners for taking this work forward and I look forward to hearing more about the experiences people have of using this scheme. People seeking asylum in the UK are generally restricted from working and have no recourse to public funds. However, they need to travel to access legal advice, social support, medical appointments and get the essentials that everyone requires. The New Scots refugee integration strategy is a partnership developed and led by the Scottish Government, COSLA and the Scottish Refugee Council. Scottish Ministers have always been clear that people who seek asylum in Scotland should be welcomed and supported to integrate into our communities from day one."

Young Roots,Young refugees are at unprecedented risk of homelessness,28-Nov-23,https://www.youngroots.org.uk/blog/young-refugees-are-at-unprecedented-risk-of-homelessness,"Lisa Matthews, Policy & Campaigns Manager Receiving a positive decision on your asylum claim should be moment of great relief – time to begin a new chapter of your life, in safety, and look to the future. But – because of mishandling of the asylum backlog which has meant hundreds of thousands of asylum applications have sat undecided for months and years - this moment of celebration has become a moment of crisis. In the past, people who were housed in asylum accommodation while waiting for a decision on their case were given 28 days’ notice that they would have to leave that accommodation after being recognised as a refugee (after being recognised as a refugee, someone can access mainstream homelessness support and benefits, like British citizens can). 28 days is not enough time to get through all the necessary systems needed to prevent someone ending up sleeping on the streets. The government’s own position is that at least 56 days is needed in order to prevent homelessness. And yet, since August 2023 newly recognised refugees have been receiving just seven days’ notice that they have to leave their asylum accommodation. Seven days’ notice that you will be made homeless … after waiting two years for a decision on your asylum application. This is what happened to Mohammed from Syria, and Ahmed from Sudan, and Khalid from Syria, and Samuel from Eritrea. These are all young people we’re working with at Young Roots (we’ve changed their names to protect their identity). Seven days is not enough time for people to find their own accommodation to prevent homelessness. Seven days is not enough time to prove that someone is vulnerable and therefore ‘priority need’ and housed by the local authority – especially as the issues that make someone vulnerable take time and trust to explore and evidence. It is important that the Home Office are finally making some progress on the asylum backlog but the mismanaged way of doing this (a huge backlog growing for years then making large numbers of decisions in a very short period) at the same of time as giving newly recognised refugees much less notice that they will be made homeless has created a crisis. Already underfunded homelessness services and organisations cannot cope with the sudden peak in need; refugee charities like Young Roots are working ceaselessly with an ever-growing number of young people in this situation – doing everything we can to try and prevent young refugees ending up sleeping on the streets. Our Caseworkers are spending hours each week advocating for young refugees to make sure that those who are vulnerable are recognised as priority need and therefore legally entitled to accommodation to prevent them being homeless. They are also spending hours finding alternative solutions for young people who haven’t been accepted to be priority need – but in a situation when more people than ever need these solutions. The Big Issue has reported that in London (where we work), the change in Home Office practice has led to a doubling in the number of rough sleepers who have recently left asylum accommodation."
Young Roots,"Introducing our new Chief Executive, Paola Uccellari",20-Oct-23,https://www.youngroots.org.uk/blog/a-message-from-our-new-chief-executive-paola-uccellari,"We are delighted to announce the appointment of Paola Uccellari as the new Chief Executive of Young Roots. Paola will lead Young Roots in developing our next strategic plan, establishing our policy, influencing and campaigning function and continuing to strengthen the organisation and our services for young people. Paola will build on the enormous achievements of Young Roots’ outgoing CEO, Jo Cobley, who grew the charity’s reach and impact enormously during her seven years in post. Having held senior leadership roles at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), the Children’s Rights Alliance for England, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Law Society, Paola brings to the role impressive strategic leadership experience and a deep commitment to securing the rights of young refugees. She has extensive experience of successfully influencing law, policy and practice to advance human rights and of overseeing high quality services to improve outcomes for people who are at risk. A message from Paola: “It is an honour to have been appointed to lead the brilliant team at Young Roots and a privilege to work with the young people who drive everything we do. The ‘Illegal’ Migration Act has destroyed young people’s most basic rights to seek protection here, brought back draconian powers allowing children to be detained and made it more likely that they will be treated as adults and denied essential rights all children should have. In this brutal context, our work with young people, which supports them to navigate a hostile system, offers them opportunities and hope and, above all, shows them humanity, kindness and community, is more important than ever. The appalling situation facing the young people we work with means that Young Roots has a crucial role to play in changing the system, ensuring that young people’s experiences, views and needs are heard and acted upon by the policy-makers whose decisions shape their lives so fundamentally.” A message from our Chair of Trustees, Grace Capel: “We are delighted that Paola has joined Young Roots as Chief Executive. Paola’s impressive career history demonstrates her dedication to our mission of improving the wellbeing and life chances of young refugees. Paola will lead an exceptional staff team in continuing to provide high quality services and activities through our Advice and Support Hubs and vital Casework service. Her strategic leadership experience will be a huge advantage to Young Roots as we develop our plans for 2024 – 2027 and address the impact of the appalling ‘Illegal’ Migration Act. As we increase our focus on policy, influencing and campaigning, Paola’s expertise will help propel our work to change the broken systems that fail to support and protect young people seeking safety in the UK. I very much look forward to working with Paola in her new role”."

Migrant Action,Re-imagining hopeful futures- Hate Crime Awareness Week and Black History Month,26-Nov-23,https://migrantaction.org.uk/re-imagining-hopeful-futures-hate-crime-awareness-week-and-black-history-month/,"In October, the Migration Partnership Barnsley hosted 2 events to mark Hate Crime Awareness Week and Black History Month. Both events brought together people from diverse backgrounds, mainstream services, Local Authority, community organisations and the local authority reflected on issues relating to hate crime, community cohesion and racial justice. The activities offered opportunities for community engagement, evaluative reflection and envisioning of a more hopeful future for our communities whereby hate crime, poverty, inequality, racial and social injustice would neither be routine, trivialised, or institutionalised. Foregrounding lived experiences, guest speakers and participants acknowledged the importance of public education, rethinking and resourcing community-led approaches to combat all forms of hate and discrimination, more investment in aspirational projects for young people, building leadership capacity in communities towards more diverse and inclusive decision making, creating pathways for local influencing by people with lived experience, tackling root causes of hate and other forms of structural injustice and better infrastructural support for vulnerable and marginalised communities. Essentially, the events articulated a shared dream of a community re-imagining a bold, ambitious, and aspirational future that is more equitable, resilient, welcoming, inclusive, harmonious, and thriving. Migrant Action and its partners continue to play a vital role as convenor and facilitator of inclusive dialogues that centre people and communities of lived experience to inspire and shape transformational social change. This is critical for migrant justice."
Migrant Action,Migration Multi-Agency Event  06/09/2023,29-Sep-23,https://migrantaction.org.uk/migration-multi-agency-event-06-09-2023/,"By Ash Eloise OBrien, Communications and Social Media Intern at Migrant Action Student interns are integral to our team and make a significant contribution to its work. Although their work is mostly remote, it is essential, where possible, that they have a direct experience of Migrant Actions work by familiarising themselves with migration issues in the field. Recently, we attended a migration multi-agency event in Barnsley, organised by the Migration Partnership Barnsley and co-coordinated by Migrant Action. The multi-agency drop-in provides holistic support for vulnerable migrants in Barnsley. This service fills a vital gap in provisions for vulnerable migrants who exist at the edges of society and struggle to access mainstream services. Mental Health and Migration The themes of the event were mental health and community resilience, focusing on how we can best support migrant communities and improve accessibility to mental health services for all. Each group was tasked with answering some questions on the services in our area, beginning by naming what is available and then discussing the gaps in provisions and the main difficulties found by staff working with migrants struggling with mental health issues. Some issues in particular stood out to us, for instance, challenges with translation. This includes inconsistency in translators being present to enable migrants to communicate with medical professionals. There were also dialect complications, and issues with the presumption that a client was struggling with English when the issue was mental health-based, such as dementia. Also mentioned was the assumption that migrants who had lived in the UK for an extended period would see their English proficiency improve over time, which we know to be untrue unless migrants are provided with opportunities to study and learn the English language. Naturally, migrants also struggle with the stigma surrounding mental health, as any person would, as well as the lengthy waiting lists, specific criteria for diagnosis, lack of communication between services, and shortened duration of support with little or no follow-up. Another interesting point was the option to travel home for health services, which for many migrants is cheaper and quicker. Some organisations and health professionals are working to ensure this is no longer the case, as consistent and accessible procedures should be available to migrants in the UK. Guests Mayor James Michael Stowe of Barnsley attended the event, speaking on the chosen theme for his mayoral year, Inclusive Communities, which resonates with the overarching theme of the event and Migrant Actions social and migrant justice aims. He discussed the importance of raising awareness of the opportunities and support the council can offer and highlighting what support projects and initiatives the voluntary, community and charitable sector deliver to support all aspects of inclusivity. We then heard from two incredible migrant clients, who both struggled with mental health after arriving in the UK and eventually found support through charitable organisations. One migrant originally from Madrid, Spain, spoke about their mental health issues while in Spain and once they moved to the UK. They believe that two of the most important aspects of support are normalisation, creating a destigmatised, safe environment for individuals to speak up about their struggles, and easily accessible support for all, found through counselling or workshop services, which they found to be beneficial. Their key messages were that things are changing for the better, but there is still much more work to be done and that empathy from doctors and service providers is lacking in some places. The next client, from El Salvador, spoke next, describing their mental health journey in the UK and how the barriers created by various public services were frustrating. Family Lives was able to help them with appointments and medications. However, unfortunately mental health issues can be highly complicated, resulting in the need to trial various methods before finding what truly works. Thankfully, the two clients are both in much better places with their mental health now because of the support provided by remarkable organisations like Family Lives. However, many migrants continue to struggle each day, and it was integral to each discussion held at this event that our collective goal was to leave nobody behind, feeling lost and unable to access help and support. Key messages A central aim of our network is to provide accurate signposting for each client, connecting them with the service they need. As there are often a few different options for those struggling with mental health, it is vital that migrants are accompanied through the process of finding help. A degree of hand-holding throughout this journey can ensure that somebody feels safe, secure and protected. Once individuals have made that first huge step in seeking help, a mental health service should provide them with the best expertise and support possible through personalised, sympathetic advocacy. Building trust and confidence between clients and workers is an essential aspect of these services, and ensuring some level of consistency, where we can, throughout the process. Moreover, no client should feel unsatisfied with the duration of support provided at the perceived end of their journey; engaging properly with follow-up processes is as crucial a part as any. Conclusion At Migrant Action, we believe that migrant-designed, migrant-led, and migrant-focused services are best equipped to help migrants through mental health difficulties. Lived experience gives workers and volunteers the best chance of truly understanding their struggles and forming client connections. This experience must exist at all levels so that decision-makers are well-informed and can approach issues with understanding and compassion. Awareness is fundamental, as is the adaptability of a service to provide that personalised level of support mentioned previously. The work carried out by organisations at this event is exceptional, and we found it inspiring to hear from so many passionate individuals who have dedicated their lives to helping those in need. However, as detailed here, there is much work to be done. We look forward to continuing these discussions and connecting with other organisations to come together and provide our best support."
Bristol Refugee Rights,In our language there are no words for depression: building resilience and wellbeing under the Hostile Environment,11-Jan-23,https://www.bristolrefugeerights.org/uncategorized/in-our-language-there-are-no-words-for-depression/,"By Alice Cutler Wellbeing; is defined as the state of being comfortable, healthy, or happy. People seeking asylum and refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health than the UK population, including high rates of depression, PTSD and other anxiety disorders (Refugee Council 2022; Morgan et. al., 2017). While mental health problems that refugees and asylum seekers face are linked to pre-migration experiences (such as war trauma), they are also linked to post-migration conditions (such as separation from family, difficulties with asylum procedures and poor housing). Distress among displaced people is very common, and is not in itself a mental illness though can persist without timely and appropriate support networks. Common mental illnesses in displaced adults include PTSD (31%), depression (31%), anxiety disorders (11%), and psychosis (1.5%). There are also high rates of distress, grief and PTSD in displaced people under the age of 18, especially in the context of war and trauma (Academy of Medical Royal Colleges 2020). Yet, people seeking asylum and refugees experience a number of unique barriers to accessing treatment  both systemic and individual. In 2014 BRR launched a project to be able to focus on wellbeing. We explored tools that would help us to evaluate the impact that we were having and wrestled with how different cultures and languages talk about mental health and wellbeing. We began to use the 5 ways to wellbeing to describe our services; Connect, Take Notice, Be active, Keep Learning, Give Over the past two years there has been an increase in people talking about wellbeing. We have all been through a global pandemic, there is increasing understanding of the need for preventative work and self care to prevent mental illness. As an organisation we have strong roots in psychologically informed ways of working, we were set up by retired professionals including social workers and mental health practitioners. However, in 2022, with stress levels in the general population higher than ever and high staff turnover it has felt like time to focus more concretely on becoming more trauma informed in everything that we do. Walking into the BRR office there is a large sign with an arrow pointing past a vibrant flower bed filled with lavender, vegetables and trees. A small group of volunteers are having a coffee together before their shift and admiring the pergola that stretches across the beds. A member arrives who has not been here before and rings the bell, our receptionist greets them with the warmest of smiles. As someone with lived experience of the system and a long standing volunteer she knows the importance of a good welcome. She escorts them up to the main hall. He is met by a multilingual staff member, a highly skilled interpreter who was a volunteer and now has finally got their status. He explains what will happen next. It is the last week of the Afghan group, a service delivered by Trauma Foundation South West, their first group therapy, set up in response to long waiting lists and the desperate situation for many people from Afghanistan. BRR provided the room and paid for an interpreter. We didnt know if it would work, at first people could only talk about their own struggles but a real sense of group support has developed. our staff member tells me. After being offered tea and a seat to wait to do an assessment, our staff member shows them around: There is a barber, an important contribution to feeling OK can be a haircut! Or you could join in the scrabble! After the new member interview the first priority is to fill in a Haven referral form which asks for any immediate health needs. The new member reports sleep problems, nightmares and pain in his leg from an injury. Our volunteer yoga teacher, drops off the mats from the stretch and relax group. Another has arrived to help with distribution of smartphones, whatever else we can do to support wellbeing it is often access to Whatsapp and connections with loved ones that makes the biggest difference. Back at the office, recently covered in plants due to a donation; someone is photocopying for her basic literacy class. Its only a few people and lasts just 40 minutes but its about as long as some can manage. We aim to build confidence for people to feel OK in a classroom, this is like phonics for adults. The advice workers are preparing for a monthly, mental health pathways meeting to help understand where people are at and if consent has been given to coordinate work. He has said that he will try to take his own life if he goes back there but there is literally no other choice for him. It is so hard to distinguish between the high level of distress many of our members experience and an active safeguarding risk. We have to be careful about setting expectations and to protect our staff from being overwhelmed. At the end of the day we aim to treat each person as a human with needs that although we can not always meet, we acknowledge them and work within our capacity to do what we can.Sanctuary in Chichester"
Sanctuary in Chichester,New schools liaison project,28-Jan-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/01/28/new-schools-liaison-project/,"We’re developing a project to support children, parents and schools with the challenges faced by refugee and asylum-seeking children in their education (including those who arrive here alone). Children usually learn English faster than their parents, so they are unable to get support with homework from their families, and our volunteers have been helping out informally. In many cases, one or both parents didn’t finish or have any formal education when they were children and may be illiterate. They can find it difficult to understand how school works here and deal with communications with schools. Another issue is that learning difficulties are often not picked up or referred if children aren’t literate in English, which is of course harder for them to achieve if they have additional learning needs – a vicious cycle. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children often have very little or no education, and may not be literate in their own language, so they really struggle when put on GCSE courses. Teaching staff are not equipped to support learning for children like this, and can also feel overwhelmed at the enormity of the challenge. Viewing all these issues together, it is clear there is a gap in structured support for children, parents, teachers and schools that we hope to start addressing with our new project. Do you have expertise on any or all of these issues? We’re looking for people to advise us as we develop our work on this. Please get in touch if you think you can help ?"

As always the children spin their own interpretation on the theme presented .” Creations included stars for a Christmas tree that was on show at Petworth House over Christmas, and volunteers took a group of the children and their families to see the tree.

Sanctuary in Chichester,New English support sessions for driving tests,20-Mar-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/03/20/new-english-support-sessions-for-driving-tests/,"Not being able to drive is a significant barrier to gaining employment (and general independence) in our local area, because the public transport network doesn’t often provide the routes people need. We have therefore long been asked by refugees for support in getting their driving licence, whether it’s with English for driving terminology, volunteers providing driving practice, or help with filling out applications and making bookings. Kerry Foster, Pathways to Independence Manager , found that there is currently a large cohort among those we support who are at various stages of trying to get their driving licence, and that a major issue everyone is struggling with is lack of specialised English for taking the theory and practical tests. In response, Kerry has set up a weekly class which started last week and was very well attended. She is using DVLA resourced materials and will also be including information around vehicle maintenance, insurance, MOTs, tax and other aspects of driving in the UK that attendees have told us they struggle to understand. As part of registering for the class, participants fill a questionnaire about their previous driving experience, English language ability and background so we can gain a better understanding of people’s needs for future classes, and so that we can track their progress as part of their overall pathways to independence. As well as being able to pursue employment opportunities, driving enables people to attend medical appointments, go to the supermarket, take their family on outings etc – all journeys that refugees who don’t have a UK driving licence or car are reliant on our volunteers for. Classes are mixed gender (because, encouragingly, participants told us this would be acceptable) and aim to support cultural integration as part of wider learning on the terminology, rules and etiquette of UK roads. Attendees are from various countries and a diversity of backgrounds and cultures within each country, so these sessions will be really positive for cross-cultural solidarity as well as getting people ‘on the road’ to employment! Kerry said, “ It’s so fantastic that so many people have signed up for the class, and seeing that we are really meeting an unmet need. I’m looking forward to following people’s progress with getting their driving licence but also seeing how this impacts their overall route to independence and integration, and generally building a fulfilling life for themselves. “"
Sanctuary in Chichester,Sculptures and art cathedral exhibition celebrating resilience and values for Refugee Week,30-Apr-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/04/30/sculptures-and-art-cathedral-exhibition-celebrating-resilience-and-values-for-refugee-week/,"Resilience in Clay is a an exhibition of seven heads of people who have made Chichester their home, by Sanctuary in Chichester (SiC) volunteer and sculptor Kate Viner, showing for three months from the 13th June. As part of this project, Kate has also been working with the SiC weekly women’s group and other members of our community including volunteers, to produce individual creative contributions on the topic of values in various media, which together will form a piece called A Common Thread, which will also be displayed alongside the sculptures and installed by the women’s group. Kate describes Resilence in Clay as, “ celebrating cultural values and what our new more diverse community brings to Chichester. It’s also a celebration also for aaaalll of Sanctuary. ” Everyone who is a part of SiC is invited to join in – “ the more the merrier! “. The whole process has been highly participatory from the beginning, with Kate centering the benefits of the project for the contributors and paid subjects. The women’s group has been working on their creations along with Kate at their weekly meet-ups, where they also have English lessons and we provide a crèche to allow those with small children to focus on their work. There are some very moving examples of people – both sculpture subjects and members of the women’s group – who were so lacking in self-belief at the start, that they avoided eye contact. Now they are full of confidence, producing their own art works and having fun joining in with group activities and discussions. The process of making oneself vulnerable as a sculpture subject or by sharing one’s own values and culture, and the resulting increase in trust and confidence has meant that people wanted to share their stories with Kate and with each other, providing a therapeutic outlet for them and building friendships. This is despite the fact that many of the women hardly speak any English and often don’t have a common language to communicate in – they’re supporting each other to express themselves. Kate says that, “ working on the values piece all together as a group has meant that there has been lots of bonding. It’s very moving to see how excited everyone is, and seeing people who have been here the longest, mainly from Syria, helping the newer arrivals, mainly from Afghanistan, and people taking it in turns to teach the others. ” To start with there was only one Ukrainian going to the women’s group but more have started coming along and wanting to get involved, so the project is encouraging bonding across various cultures. An example of values we’ve learned about is that in Afghanistan the central values are hospitality and optimism – this won’t surpise anyone who has been to an Afghan home; there is always an array of nuts and dried fruit on pretty dishes, ready for any unexpected visitors, and while guests are served tea there is usually some frying or baking going on, with the resulting delicious treats coming out of the kitchen a few minutes later. Kate describes the “flow of optimisim” that she sees “across the board”; “ The strength and resilience of everyone, and the sense of humour is extraordinary. What I have learned through this experience is absolutely backed up but what we’re trying to do here [at the charity] . I see it everyday. It’s a huge privilege so see people’s resilience and strength – I feel really proud of Sanctuary, and have a sense of respect for our community. I feel very emotional about the volunteers too, I think they are exrtaordinary and I am learning about everyone’s appreciation for Sanctuary. “ We look forward to seeing you at the cathedral!

Sanctuary in Chichester,Subjects of sculpture exhibition describe their experience of the project…,30-Jun-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/06/30/subjects-of-sculpture-exhibition-describe-their-experience-of-the-project/,"The exhibition Resilience in Clay , by Sanctuary volunteer Kate Viner, is showing at Chichester Cathedral until the end of August. It consists of seven sculptures of the heads of members of our community, and throughout the creative process Kate has centred the benefits of the project to the subjects of her work. Here the subjects describe their experience of sitting for Kate and being a part of the project: “I am very happy with the whole project, and have a warm relationship with Kate. No present concerns but will ask you if I do. Kate has been superb at planning and coordinating the contributions from participants who could have been initially shy of contributing. She won their confidence, encouraged their embroidery and expressions of values, leading to several fine pieces I have seen. She asked me to contribute life thoughts and a small embroidery of the South Downs as well as a head. It has been a unique experience and an exciting prospect.” “I really enjoyed the whole process with Kate, she is amazing and so understanding. I can’t wait to see the exhibition “ “I’m very happy that I’m a part of this project. Kate is an amazing artist who can create realistic artwork that I admire. I had fun modeling for her.” “I enjoyed working with Kate, she is very attentive and sensitive. Posing for a sculpture is a completely new experience for me, but thanks to Kate, I felt absolutely no discomfort. I want to add to what has already been said that I enjoyed watching the work of a talented master – Kate. I’m glad to be a part of such a great project. When Kate asked me to be her model, I couldn’t believe that she was so interested in my face that she wanted to sculpt it. I never considered my face to be somehow beautiful or special. But Kate endeared me to her so much that I wanted to help her in this project. I also want to tell you and everyone involved in this project, thank you very much for raising such an important topic – refugees. Thanks “ “I would like to say that this was an amazing opportunity in many different ways.” “I personally found it so relaxing as I am currently taking an access course which is academic study plus balancing with my six children and working full-time. For me having one hour sitting down with a cup of coffee chatting with someone who has humanity and love like her (Kate) I found so relaxing.” “My current artwork will have the words ‘Where there is love, there is no darkness’. This means that love has the ability to push out darkness. I chose this phrase because love brings light, positivety, and understanding into our lives, creating an environment free from darkness or negativity. Love has the ability to transform and uplift individuals and communities, creating a more harmonious and compassionate world.” “It is a beautiful thing [taking part], and the most beautiful thing is that you hear a lot from people who support you.” “People who will come to this exhibition, I think, when they see these sculptures, they will think about the fate of the people depicted, what they had to endure, how they cope with all the difficulties in a foreign country. And maybe they will think about their lives, think how lucky they are that they live in a peaceful country and they do not need to run away from here trying to hide from some kind of danger. And they will appreciate every day they live even more, and hug their loved ones even tighter when they are nearby. I think this is the most important thing in life – to appreciate what you have, to appreciate the one who is next to you, to spend as much time with each other as possible and to tell your loved ones how dear they are to you. After all, we only have one life and it is so fleeting.” These quotes were given from before the exhibition opened, and the sitters have since been attending opening events, been interviewed by the BBC and more, so will undoubtedly have more to say on their more recent experiences of the project – we will post updates soon…"
Sanctuary in Chichester,A Culinary Journey: Exploring Syria Through Cuisine,27-Aug-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/08/27/a-culinary-journey-exploring-syria-through-cuisine/,"The inspiring story behind the new food business E&J Syrian Cuisine is one of resilience, perseverance, passion, a dream – and a love of food and cooking. Eyad and Joyhana arrived in Chichester four and a half years ago with their five children. Eyad, with years of experience in the culinary world, had established a street food restaurant in his hometown of Homs, Syria, before the war. “I have been cooking for a long time,” he shares. “I worked extensively in Syria and love working. My aim has always been to make customers happy with my food.” The couple set up their new food delivery service earlier this summer, delivering dishes to trial the business (our volunteers were their first customers, providing feedback and ideas for improvement), then starting their page on Deliveroo. They explain that the dishes all have their own culturally important histories and that they want trying the food to feel like a journey into the heart of Syrian culture. The menu celebrates the country’s rich culinary heritage, with each dish crafted with love and narrating a different story, from the bustling streets of Aleppo to the serene landscapes of the countryside. We recommend the aromatic Shawarma or the tasty Kabsa Rice, and for vegetarians, the Falafel Wrap is also a must-try. When asked about his dreams since arriving in the UK, Eyad’s aspirations are clear: “I dream of owning a restaurant where everyone comes to eat and leaves happy. If my financial situation improves, I want to help the less fortunate, especially orphaned children.” Setting up their own business in the UK has been transformative for the family after several years of struggle trying to get on their feet. Eyad describes the feeling as “stepping into the light from the dark, like stepping onto the moon.” His hopes for the future are simple yet profound: to meet his children’s and parent’s needs, travel with them, and own their own restaurant. Eyad said, “I want to thank Kerry, who dedicated much time to help us set up. Fern, who convinced and encouraged me to start this project. Simon for finalising the menu, and Toby and Pzemek for their contributions. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the initial food purchase; finally, thank you, Sanctuary in Chichester, for their unwavering support.” Kerry Foster, Sanctuary’s Pathways to Independence Manager, said, “It has been a pleasure supporting this family to realise their dreams.  When I was first introduced to the family, they had been here nearly four years and felt that they were not moving forward. They were desperate to utilise their skills and love of Syrian food and share this with their local community as well as become independent through working and running their own business.” E&J Syrian Cuisine has already garnered lots of positive reviews from the community. There was excellent volunteer feedback during the pilot, and positive reviews are also starting to come in on Deliveroo. ‘Very tasty and plenty. We all enjoyed it very much and will order again!’ and compliments on the friendly service, value for money and ‘Best hummus in a long while!’. Kerry continues: “There have been and continue to be many steps on their ‘pathway to independence’ and starting up a new business in a new country with many barriers to progress is no easy feat, but they are hardworking, motivated, proactive, resilient and determined and that is the recipe for success!” She added: “A big thank you to all the SiC volunteers who have and continue to support the family along their journey to independence” So why not give them a try? By supporting E&J Syrian Cuisine, you’re not just enjoying a meal but celebrating a culture, nurturing a personal dream, and becoming part of a larger human story."
Sanctuary in Chichester,‘Resilience in Clay’ Sculpture Subjects Describe Their Experiences at Cathedral Event,28-Aug-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/08/28/resilience-in-clay-sculpture-subjects-describe-their-experiences-at-cathedral-event/,"As the Resilience in Clay exhibition at Chichester Cathedral comes to a close, a special In Conversation event was held at The Vicar’s Hall on the 26th August. The evening was hosted by the cathedral and Chichester Cathedral Friends. It began with an introduction from Interim Dean of Chichester, The Reverend Canon Simon Holland, followed by a moving talk from exhibition artist and Sanctuary volunteer Kate Viner. Sanctuary in Chichester trustee Philippa Gogarty provided an introduction to the challenges faced by asylum seekers, and the event concluded with a panel discussion featuring exhibition participants sharing their experiences. First of all, Simon gave his emotional and intellectual response to the exhibition, saying how it was at first uncomfortable for him to be confronted by the powerful sculptures every day at work. They made him challenge his own perceptions and views. Then, as time went by, and Simon processed his feelings, they became familiar and more comfortable, but no less moving. He thanked the sitters present for this enriching experience. Kate described how much she had learned from getting to know the seven sitters for her sculptures, each spending six three-hour sessions with the sculptor. She also paid tribute to the inspirational resilience shown by the sitters and read out some of the messages of welcome, encouragement and solidarity that had been left by visitors at the cathedral. Finally, Kate thanked Chichester Cathedral for their bravery in hosting the exhibition during their busiest months. Philippa gave the audience some of the insights she had gained from volunteering in Calais and then taking in a young asylum seeker called Asme who she and her husband Rory helped through the asylum application process while he was living with them. When she first met Asme, Philippa described her shock at the fact that there was nowhere on the planet that he could legally call home. The panel discussion was led by Simon and Gemma Driver, another Sanctuary in Chichester trustee, who asked the refugee panel about their experiences of the UK and of sitting for Kate, as well as how their participation in the exhibition has impacted them. All of them described what an eye-opening opportunity the exhibition had been and how Kate had been so kind and lacking in any judgment during the process. The panel consisted of: Donya from Iran, sculpture sitter and designer of the magazine that accompanied the ‘A Common Thread’ section of the exhibition (embroidered contributions on values from community members); Lyse from Burundi, sculpture sitter, student, care worker and mother to six children; Dalal from Syria who is currently volunteering with UK Harvest (and her son Walid who helped with translation); and Walid from Afghanistan, ex-BBC Afghanistan journalist, author of an article in the magazine on the increasing gender apartheid faced by women and girls in Afghanistan. Dalal described Kate as “so warm-hearted” and said that she had “learned a lot” from Kate. Lyse explained that she takes negative experiences and turns them into positives, and how this gives her strength. She never expected to go to university but is now about to start her degree at the University of Chichester. The experience of sitting for Kate, feeling listened to, building their friendship and having time away from her six children to reflect brought richness and additional strength to her life. Lyse also told the audience about being blown away by her friend crying when she came to see the sculptures – a common experience among many of the people present who had seen friends and strangers alike become emotional upon seeing the exhibition. Donya explained how being part of the exhibition and seeing it displayed in the cathedral has been “a spiritual experience” for her, while Walid spoke about how life has worsened for people in Afghanistan in the three months since he wrote the article, due to the Taliban’s increased oppression of women and girls, and how he appreciated the opportunity to write the article and express his point-of-view to exhibition visitors. At the end, another sitter who had been in the audience stood up to thank Kate. Pam is a volunteer with Sanctuary in Chichester and a guide at Chichester Cathedral as well as being descended from refugees, so it meant a lot to her to be part of the exhibition and to see visitors’ responses to it. She described her great respect for Kate’s work and how the three-hour sculpting sessions flew by because the conversation with Kate was so interesting. Finally, John Siebert, Chair of the Cathedral Friends thanked Kate for the exhibition and everything it had brought to the cathedral as well as to everyone who had seen it and everybody involved in it. We will post a recording of the event here shortly – hopefully next week…"
Sanctuary in Chichester,Giving Back: Beneficiaries’ Empowerment through Volunteering with UK Harvest and St Wilfrid’s Hospice,28-Aug-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/08/28/uk-harvest-and-st-wilfrids/,"Community is at the heart of what we do. We have started working with UK Harvest (food rescue and education charity) and St Wilfrid’s Hospice to help people give back and grow together. A major challenge for asylum seekers is that they are not allowed to work at all for the first year that their application is being considered, and are then only able to apply to work in certain roles that are on the UK’s ‘Shortage Occupation’ list – usually highly skilled jobs requiring qualifications they don’t have or within the care sector. Those who arrive with refugee status and are allowed to work still face a number of barriers to finding a job, and it takes time and perseverance to break through those barriers. In the meantime, volunteering can make a big difference. It gives people purpose, increased confidence and a routine, they learn about UK workplace culture and expectations (often very different from their countries of origin), they make friends from diverse backgrounds and learn new skills. Last month, we – along with UK Harvest and St. Wilfrid’s Hospice – helped four people to start volunteering. It’s part of how we support people to get ready for life in the UK and find the work they want to do. One of our recent additions to the team is Rahim (not his real name), who has joined the eCommerce team at St Wilfrid’s Hospice. He’s helping raise funds by listing donated items on eBay. His energy and enthusiasm have been a great boost to the team. We hope that Rahim will gain as much from his volunteering as the Hospice does from his hard work. Amina (not her real name), who recently came to Chichester, is now volunteering with UK Harvest and St Wilfrid’s. She said, “UK Harvest is doing something really good. I’m using my time positively, and I’m learning a lot. Volunteering at St. Wilfrid’s is a unique and positive experience for me.” Kerry Foster runs our Pathways to Independence (PTI) programme, supporting beneficiaries like Rahim and Amina on their own pathways by encouraging them to think about the steps they need to take towards future aspirations, and to set goals and milestones along the way. Kerry said, “Seeing a positive change in someone’s wellbeing through their volunteering work is priceless. Having spent time with individuals to understand and develop their own ‘pathways to independence’, for some, volunteering is a key step towards fulfilling their overall hopes and potential for their new life in the UK. Many of our beneficiaries were highly skilled and successful in their own countries, then find themselves having to start all over again in an environment that is new and daunting as well as having to support their children through school. Volunteering not only supports integration and allows individuals to give back to the community, it helps individuals begin to see what they have to offer the community and consider how their skills and knowledge could be adapted and transferred into the UK workforce.”  Collaborating with local charities to support people into volunteering is therefore an important development for the Pathways to Independence programme. Kerry sends, “A big thank you to Will Wallace, Volunteer Manager at UK Harvest, and Emma Lemm, Volunteer Services Manager at St Wilfrid’s, for providing these opportunities”. A representative of St Wilfrid’s said of the collaboration, “Supporting Sanctuary in their important cause has been a privilege for us in eCommerce”. These stories show how volunteering can change lives. It helps people gain transferable skills, self-esteem and become part of the community. If you are interested in volunteering with Sanctuary in Chichester, you could also benefit enormously from supporting individuals directly.

Sanctuary in Chichester,Celebrating Togetherness at Our Annual Summer Party &,28-Aug-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/08/28/drop-ins-update/,"Summer Drop-Ins The much-anticipated summer party on July 31st was a huge success, despite the weather playing spoilsport. The marquee was abuzz with activity, and the array of cakes was a sight to behold. Chris North thoroughly entertained the children, and the Ukrainian Volya Choir’s music added to the festive spirit. One sentiment that stood out was the deep sense of belonging many felt. As one attendee put it, “This isn’t just a party; it’s a family reunion.” While it was a day of celebration, it was also a day of goodbyes as we bid farewell to Fern, who has been such an important part of the support we provide – thank you for all your hard work and dedication Fern, you will be missed! Beyond the summer party, our weekly drop-ins continued at full speed throughout July and August, with each gathering having its own fun features. At the beginning of July, despite the intermittent rain, the children had a blast playing outside and making slime indoors. As the weeks rolled on, art took centre stage. The craft table at the drop-in was bustling, and the diversity of donated materials led to some fabulous creations including some stunning painting-collage combinations. At the end of July, we welcomed Kateryna Tsarkova, a Ukrainian bandura player, who gave an impromptu recital. We also introduced two new members to our team, Claudie Fleming and James Field, who will be instrumental in supporting our beneficiaries. We also had visitors from the Community Programme at Pallant House Gallery, who introduced an exciting opportunity for our beneficiaries to be part of an upcoming exhibition – more info on this coming soon… The packed calendar continued into August, with cultural events and community activities as well as the drop-ins. Highlights included the Ukraine Independence Day celebration hosted by Volya Choir, and enriching discussions at the In Conversation event towards the end of the Resilience in Clay Exhibition at Chichester Cathedral . Additionally, Pallant House Gallery’s creative workshops were a hit, especially those with the theme of crafting 3-D cats, and the ESOL Summer School also saw enthusiastic participation . A heartfelt thank you goes to everyone who attended, volunteered and contributed to the summer party, drop-ins and other events."
Sanctuary in Chichester,Report on Our Summer Intensive English Course,28-Aug-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/08/28/summer-esol-course/,"The biggest barrier people face in building their new lives in the UK is a lack of English. Finding work, dealing with bureaucracy, schools, healthcare, understanding systems and making friends are all very difficult without English and our volunteers spend a lot of time helping with these things when people who don’t speak English first arrive. We also have a team of qualified volunteer English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) tutors, who support individuals to make real progress in English. This August, our volunteer tutors ran a special intensive two-week summer ESOL course for 13 students. It covered practical topics like finding a job in the UK, understanding schools, staying safe on the roads, health and wellbeing. One fun part was a tour of Chichester, where – after a classroom session on history and geography – everyone learned more about the city’s history, led by one of our tutors who is a professional tour guide. The course ended with a party, where everyone practised English conversation and played some traditional English party games. The highlight of the party was singing a sea shanty led by another of our tutors who is a professional singer. Thanks to our trustee and ESOL Lead, Lois Smith, our awesome tutors and of course our determined learners, the course was a big success. One student said, “This wasn’t just about learning English; it was about finding a sense of belonging.” We’re also excited that our volunteers have supported 12 more people to sign up for ESOL lessons at Chichester College. Now, over 22 of our friends are learning English there. It’s a big step towards feeling at home in the UK and finding work. If you’re an ESOL teacher and would like to give some of your time to supporting refugees, come and join us !"
Sanctuary in Chichester,Meet New Members of Sanctuary’s Team: Claudie and James,28-Sep-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/09/28/meet-new-members-of-sanctuarys-team/,"We are delighted to introduce you to the latest additions to the Sanctuary in Chichester family — Claudie Fleming and James Field. Both bring unique skills and perspectives to our team, and we are very pleased to have them on board. Claudie joins us after recently graduating and is eager to dive into her role as Volunteer Coordinator. Claudie tells us: “I’ve been warmly welcomed into the Sanctuary community, and I’m thrilled to be part of this hardworking team. I’ve already had the pleasure of meeting people from diverse backgrounds, and I look forward to learning more and developing skills that will aid me in a career working with refugees and asylum seekers.” James is no stranger to Sanctuary in Chichester, having been with us at the very beginning, now returning to continue his impactful work after a career as a Headteacher. A word from James: “I’ve spent most of my career in education, and it’s a joy to return to Sanctuary in Chichester. The organisation has grown tremendously, and I’m excited to work alongside committed individuals like Claudie, Kerry, Steve, and our Trustees.” James continues: “My focus is on helping refugees across the area in various ways, and it’s rewarding to be part of such a meaningful mission.” We’re excited to see the contributions Claudie and James will make to our community!"
Sanctuary in Chichester,Trustee Mike Runs the Great South Run For Sanctuary in Chichester,28-Sep-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/09/28/trustee-mike-runs-the-great-south-run/,"Mike Mansergh, a cornerstone of our Board of Trustees, is gearing up for his fourth appearance in the Great South Run. Mike works so hard for the organisation on a voluntary basis but has somehow found time to train for the run, and this year he is of course raising money for Sanctuary in Chichester. Thank you Mike! In Mike’s words: “As the countdown to my fourth Great South Run dwindles to just one month, my enthusiasm is at an all-time high. This year, I’ve chosen to run for a cause that’s close to my heart—Sanctuary in Chichester. The tireless efforts of our volunteers are instrumental in helping individuals who have endured severe hardships find a new home in our community. It’s a privilege to contribute to such a meaningful mission.” Mike’s dedication to our mission is clear: “Sanctuary in Chichester stands as a pillar of hope for those who have been stripped of their homes and faced life-altering trauma. My volunteer work has allowed me to witness the transformative power of our initiatives, which pave the way to independence for those we serve. None of this would be possible without essential financial backing.” How you can support Mike: If you’re inspired by Mike’s amazing commitment and would like to contribute to our work, please donate to his Great South Run fundraising page."
Sanctuary in Chichester,Volunteer Training Day,28-Sep-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/09/28/volunteer-training-day/,"Last Monday, 18th September, we held a volunteer training session at St Paul’s Church Community Centre in Chichester. The focus of the event was to provide our volunteers with the necessary skills and information to support refugees and asylum seekers on an ongoing basis effectively. It was a focused and productive event with around 30 people attending. This training is essential for aligning volunteers with the mission of Sanctuary in Chichester, and topics covered included family review meetings, goal setting, and Job Centre interactions, among others. These training events are held regularly throughout the year to ensure that volunteers have the necessary information and skills to perform their roles effectively, whether they are Befrienders, English Tutors or contribute in other ways like running our social events. Some of our volunteers have multiple roles. The training was led by Philippa Gogarty, Trustee and Befriending Lead at Sanctuary in Chichester. Philippa provided insights based on her extensive experience, offering practical advice and guidelines for volunteers. During the training session, key members of the Sanctuary team shared valuable insights that spanned various aspects of our work. Philippa outlined her role and emphasised the importance of family review meetings for new arrivals. Claudie Fleming, our new Volunteer Coordinator, introduced herself and discussed the significance of setting goals for beneficiaries. Kerry Foster, Pathways to Independence Manager, provided an overview of how to interact with the Job Centre and stressed the necessity of supporting refugees to keep their Universal Credit journals updated. Trustee Mike Mansergh, who is deeply involved in the organisation, echoed the importance of maintaining updated Universal Credit journals. Trustee Evie Owen announced her new role as Schools Liaison Lead, in which she aims to keep everyone updated on school-related matters for the children we support – a highly complex challenge. One of the standout moments of the day was the discussion about the possibility of offering IT training sessions to beneficiaries. This initiative is geared towards improving their digital literacy, an increasingly important skill in today’s world, and one that many refugees and asylum seekers are missing. The event wrapped up with breakout sessions where volunteers were divided into groups based on their roles —tutors, Befrienders, and drop-in volunteers. These focused discussions allowed for a deeper understanding of each role’s unique challenges and opportunities. A critical update was shared regarding potential Home Office changes that could reduce the time for finding housing from 28 days to just seven days for those whose asylum applications are accepted. This presents a significant challenge for the refugees and our organisation, as it’s already very difficult to secure housing and employment within the current 28-day window. Given these potential changes, ongoing training and support for Befrienders will be more important than ever. The insights and skills shared during the training session will be invaluable tools for navigating these challenges. While the work of Befrienders has always been vital, these potential changes could make their role even more critical in ensuring the wellbeing and successful integration of our beneficiaries. Thank you to all the volunteers who attended the training session. Your commitment to the cause is what makes our work possible, and we appreciate your dedication to supporting refugees and asylum seekers in our community. Lastly, a special thanks to St Paul’s Church for generously providing us with the venue for the training session. Trustee Mike Mansergh is running the Great South Run in aid of Sanctuary in Chichester in October. Find out how to support him by donating here ."
Sanctuary in Chichester,Update: Sanctuary in Chichester Response to Asylum Hotel,02-Oct-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/10/02/update-sanctuary-in-chichester-response-to-chichester-park-hotel/,"Sanctuary in Chichester is gearing up to support the people housed in the hotel. This weekend some of our trustees and staff met many of the men, women and children who are accommodated there to assess how best we can support them, and work is now underway to help meet their needs. Thank you for all the messages of support. Some people have asked how they can help and there are two things that would make a big difference: donating so we can buy items or services that we are unable to source for free, and becoming a volunteer with us . Our awesome team of volunteers carry out the majority of the organisation’s vital work, and we provide the training and support needed to make it as rewarding as possible. We don’t have storage or capacity to deal with donated items, so we are very grateful to be able to source them through our partner organisations according to individual needs.

Sanctuary in Chichester,Sanctuary Selects: A Collaboration with Pallant House Gallery,09-Oct-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/10/09/sanctuary-selects-a-collaboration-with-pallant-house-gallery/,"We are thrilled to announce ‘ Sanctuary Selects ‘, a special exhibition of works curated by local refugees and asylum seekers at Pallant House Gallery. The project showcases the power of art to transcend language and cultural barriers, offering a fresh perspective on community collaboration, and is the result of the continued partnership between Sanctuary in Chichester and the gallery, and the desire of Pallant House Gallery to be as inclusive as possible in their provision. Marcus and a Pink By Patrick Procktor About the Exhibition Over the past few months, participants from Sanctuary have had the opportunity to explore Pallant House Gallery’s remarkable collection of 20th and 21st-century prints and ceramics from the Golder-Thompson Gift. They selected pieces that resonated with them and shared their responses through accompanying labels. This has sparked meaningful conversations among participants about art’s diverse interpretations and emotional impacts. Bec Hopkins, a volunteer with Sanctuary in Chichester ( and local artist ) who has been coordinating this project said: “Art transcends languages and connects all of us. What better way to learn from each other than to enjoy art? This exhibition serves as a platform for refugees and asylum seekers to share their perspectives and experiences with the wider community, aligning with the shared goals of Pallant House Gallery and Sanctuary in Chichester.” Sanctuary Selects: Voices from our Community is a FREE exhibition and runs from 6 October 2023 until 4th February 2024 in the Print Room at Pallant House Gallery .

Sanctuary in Chichester,Run Complete! Mike Mansergh Completes the Great South Run for Sanctuary,20-Oct-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/10/20/mike-mansergh-completes-run-for-sanctuary/,"Sanctuary in Chichester Trustee Mike Mansergh has successfully completed the Great South Run. Mike finished the race in an impressive 1 hour and 18 minutes, and his fundraising efforts (as well as endurance!) have really gone the extra mile. Fundraising Update Mike’s fundraising page has already collected £1263, and donations are still incoming. The page will remain open for a few more days for those who still wish to contribute, please do here . What’s Next? The funds raised will go a long way in supporting the work we do here at Sanctuary in Chichester. From providing essential basics to asylum seekers to paying for essentials to help refugees into work, every pound raised makes a real difference – especially as our staffing costs are paid for through grants, which we are extremely grateful for, and means that all other donations go directly to those we support. A Big Thank You from Mike Himself “I did the run largely due to the enormous generosity and kindness of so many in supporting my fundraising effort. Sanctuary in Chichester will be extremely appreciative of the many donations I have received. I would like to thank everyone for showing such interest in our small, but vitally important charity in Chichester, which is helping look after increasing numbers of traumatised people arriving in our area. Thank you all!”"
Sanctuary in Chichester,A Tribute for Joy Constantin,30-Oct-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/10/30/a-tribute-for-joy-constantin/,"We are very sad to announce the death of Joy Constantin, a much-loved volunteer who brought huge enthusiasm, creativity and joy to the children at the drop-in craft table. Here is a tribute for her from her friend and craft table colleague, Lynne Waylen. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to work alongside fellow volunteer Joy Constantin at the Sanctuary drop-in. It was obvious from our first joint art session that Joy delighted in the company of children, encouraging them to play and create or just talk. Never short of conversation, warm and welcoming, the children were naturally drawn to her genuine interest in them as individuals. She gave them time and space to develop their skills both creative and linguistic at their own pace. Joy certainly lived up to her name, always cheerful and positive, even when – as many of you would have witnessed – it was clear that she was struggling with fatigue in the latter stages of cancer. A tour de force, a successful creative business woman who throughout her life supported many less fortunate than ourselves. For her 80th birthday she asked friends not to bring her gifts, but to donate towards a fund enabling children at Sanctuary to enjoy a day out. Generous and caring, fun to be with, Joy will be greatly missed and remembered with much affection. Lynne."
Sanctuary in Chichester,Latest Update: The Hotel,31-Oct-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/10/31/latest-update-chichester-park-hotel/,"When refugees first arrive in the Chichester area, our first priority is to help them feel welcome and safe. With that in mind it has been lovely to welcome lots of the new residents of the local hotel to our weekly women’s group and drop-ins, and we expect to see numbers rise as people become familiar with their surroundings and get to know us. We’re also doing what we can in providing transport to these important social events, and our volunteers are stepping up as usual to give lifts to those who can’t walk far – those with small children or who have disabilities or are unwell. We had a record-breaking 132 people at the last drop-in , and with this big increase in attendees, we need additional volunteers (apply here!) for various roles, including managing the Welcome Desk, assisting with children’s activities, helping with refreshments and transport. We’re collaborating with the hotel’s management, West Sussex County Council, and other local groups to support the new arrivals, and are providing clothes, shoes, pushchairs and prams (so families with children can leave the hotel) and toys among other items. We’ve given SIM cards and phones to those without and the recipients have been very grateful. We’re also getting to grips with where along the process everyone’s asylum applications have got to so we can advise them on what to expect next and support them in communicating with the Home Office. We hope to soon have news of hairdressers who got in touch with us to generously volunteer to cut hotel residents’ hair – we’re just waiting for their DBS checks to come through. We have been inundated with kind offers of donations and support – a big thank you to everyone who has donated or got in touch! We are especially grateful to the Rotary Club for their help in sourcing and providing the items needed. We’re also grateful to My Sister’s House, including for accommodating a large number of women at their recent free clothing pop-up. If you would like to help and you are able to give us your time, please apply to become a volunteer . If you have good condition clothing, shoes or toys to donate, please take them to the new My Sister’s House, 44 Bognor Road, Chichester PO19 7TG. If you would like to donate funds , every pound makes a real difference, especially as our staffing costs are paid for through grants, which we are extremely grateful for, so all other donations go directly to those we support.

Sanctuary in Chichester,Sanctuary in Chichester AGM 2023,29-Nov-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/11/29/sanctuary-in-chichester-agm-2023/,"Sanctuary in Chichester recently held its Annual General Meeting at The Vicar’s Hall, marking a year of significant progress and setting the stage for future challenges and opportunities. Members received the annual report and an update on the charity’s finances. All current trustees were elected to continue for another year and members welcomed a new trustee Dr Waleed Hussein. Key highlights of the AGM other than the trustee election included substantial growth described in updates on the drop-in and the befriending programme, the launch of a schools liaison project, and an outline of how we are responding to the evolving needs of beneficiaries with the designation of a local hotel to house asylum seekers. Tony Toynton, said of the meeting: “It was lovely to get together with fellow trustees, volunteers, and staff to look back on a very busy year for our charity and then set out our plans to meet the significant challenges we’re already facing in this current year. It also allowed me to thank everyone for their amazing support to refugees and asylum seekers in the Chichester area.” Looking Forward As Sanctuary in Chichester moves into another year, the AGM served as a reminder of the charity’s vital role in the community. The dedication of its volunteers and staff, coupled with the support of the community, continues to make a profound difference in the lives of those seeking refuge and a new start in Chichester."
Sanctuary in Chichester,Bertie the Cathedral Cat: A Heartwarming Tail,29-Nov-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/11/29/bertie-the-cathedral-cat/,"Chichester Cathedral and Sanctuary in Chichester have joined forces again in efforts to support refugees and asylum seekers locally and to help ensure everybody feels welcome at the Cathedral. The digital story ‘Bertie the Cathedral Cat’ is a central feature of the collaboration, which will debut on December 3rd.

Volunteer Support and Community Involvement Throughout Advent and Christmas, the Cathedral will also be actively encouraging community members to support Sanctuary by volunteering with us or donating. This is very welcome, as with the recent doubling in beneficiaries we will need all the support we can get to maintain and expand our services, such as the weekly drop-ins, English tutoring, the weekly women’s group, Nations United football, help with the asylum process and various other support activities. Sanctuary in Chichester expresses deep gratitude for Chichester Cathedral’s ongoing support. This partnership helps us to addresses the immediate needs of our beneficiaries as well as plan our future work, and sets the stage for continued collaboration, enhancing our collective impact on the lives of refugees and asylum seekers."
Sanctuary in Chichester,‘Welcome to Britain’: The Colouring Book for Hope,29-Nov-23,https://sanctuaryinchichester.org/2023/11/29/welcome-to-britain/,"At Sanctuary in Chichester, we recently experienced a heartwarming gesture of solidarity and support for our young refugees and asylum seeker children, with a testament to the power of art and community. The Professional Cartoonists Organisation , moved by the removal of child-friendly murals at the Kent Intake Unit for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Dover, decided to take a stand. The murals, which were ordered to be removed by the Immigration Minister , had been a source of comfort and welcome for the children. Cartoonists Unite for a Cause In response to this disheartening event, renowned cartoonists, including the likes of Quentin Blake and Terry Gilliam, came together to create a ‘ Welcome to Britain ‘ colouring book. This initiative was not just about creating a book; it symbolised solidarity and a message to these young souls that they are welcomed and valued in the UK. The cartoonists generously offered their talents for free, and 38 Degrees supported the cause by running a fundraiser to cover printing and postage costs. Cartoon Delivery We received a generous delivery of thirty copies of the book and some crayons, which we distributed during one of our November Drop-in sessions. These gifts were particularly cherished by the children being housed at the hotel. Our heartfelt thanks go to everyone who contributed to this thoughtful gesture."
Refugee Action Scotland,38 Degrees' Colouring Books,29-Nov-23,https://www.re-act-scotland.org/copy-of-partners,"In the summer of 2023, the Home Office ordered that cartoon murals in children's asylum centres be painted over as the colourful animations were considered to be too welcoming. In response, positive action group '38 Degrees' asked several top cartoonists to create drawings about life and culture in Britain, which resulted in a children's colouring book. Our wonderful volunteer, Maggie Berrill, managed to get hold of 30 copies of the book which was positively received by children at the Re-Act playgroup. The remaining copies will go into Welcome Packs for new arrivals."
Sanctuary on Sea,Statement on missing children in Brighton & Hove,14-Dec-22,https://brighton-and-hove.cityofsanctuary.org/2022/12/14/statement-on-missing-children-in-brighton-hove,"It was reported this week* that more than 70 children had disappeared from a Hove hotel used by the Home Office to house unaccompanied young asylum seekers.  It follows the revelation in the Guardian newspaper in October that more than 220 unaccompanied children were missing from hotels funded by the Home Office, which was rightly described as a catastrophic child protection failure. This statement is on behalf of organisations supporting people who have sought sanctuary in Brighton & Hove, ahead of a debate at a full council meeting of Brighton & Hove City Council on Thursday 15 December. We are shocked to learn of the appalling number of children going missing.  One child is too many and, if they were British, it would cause serious alarm and concern.  70 children going missing in this City of Sanctuary is a scandal. Brighton & Hove City Council has duties under the Children Act 1989 and 2004 to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children in need. It needs to do more to discharge that duty for unaccompanied asylum seeking children. An investigation is needed urgently into what has gone wrong , the complex reasons behind young people absconding and how they can be addressed. We are ready to support that. But the fundamental problem is that hotels are no place for lone children.  Only local authorities can be corporate parents. The Home Office must find a way to put children directly into Councils care as soon as they arrive in the country and not place them in limbo in hotels where they are vulnerable to the traffickers who prey on them. Asylum hotels are no place for any child. Some children in Brighton & Hove have been living in an hotel funded by the Home Office for more than a year. We hear from doctors and teachers, as well as their parents, that they are simply not thriving: their physical and mental health is suffering. It is vital that the Home Office speed up its asylum decisions, clear the backlog and stop warehousing people in hotels. * We are not linking to that report as it names the three hotels used by the Home Office in Brighton & Hove. This irresponsible journalism puts the residents at unnecessary risk from traffickers and others who might wish them harm. This statement is supported by a network of groups that support refugees and migrants in Brighton & Hove, including: Best Foot Music Brighton & Hove Stand Up To Racism Brighton Quakers Sanctuary Group Care4Calais Care for Our City Cornerstone Community Centre (Hove) Hummingbird Project Make Amplify Migrant English Project Network of International Women Refugee Radio Refugee Council Sanctuary on Sea Sussex Interpreting Services Thousand for 1,000 Voices in Exile"

As UN independent experts state “There is no justification for violence that indiscriminately targets innocent civilians, whether by Hamas or Israeli forces. This is absolutely prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime.” STAR is all about creating a welcome in the UK for people who are forcibly displaced and need a place of safety to rebuild their lives. This includes ensuring that people are provided with the safe routes they need to get here. We called for safe routes for people caught up in violence when Russia invaded Ukraine, when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, and when civil war broke out in Sudan. Now we call for safe routes once again. No one should be forcibly displaced from their home, something which is against international law. However, people who feel they have no choice but to leave their country need access to safety. Gaza is a densely populated area, only 25 miles long, with a civilian population of 2.2 million people. Almost half of whom are children and 7 in 10 of whom are already refugees. Since 2007, Gaza has been subject to a strict land and sea blockade by Israel that prevents civilians and vital necessities such as food and medicine from easily moving across the border. Before the current crisis the World Food Programme estimated that more than 60% of Gaza’s population faced food insecurity. The recent escalation of the blockade of Gaza, which cut off supplies of power, water and food, and the continual bombing campaign by Israel is causing an extreme humanitarian crisis. There is nowhere safe for people to go in Gaza to escape the violence, and they can’t leave as the borders to neighbouring countries are closed. We call on the UK government to open up safe routes to the UK for those who need them and  implement an urgent family reunion scheme. We also continue our call for a fair and humane asylum system in the UK which upholds the right to asylum no matter how someone travels here, with safe routes in place that provide refugees, no matter where they come from, with a means of seeking safety in the UK. We also added our name to the call led by the Refugee Council asking emergency safe passage for people impacted by the violence in Israel and Palestine.

STAR,Why you should join STAR in 2023-2024,12-Sep-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/09/12/why-you-should-join-star-in-2023-2024/,"12 September 2023 If you’re heading to university this year, why not join the largest network of students building a society where refugees are welcomed! Get the most out of your uni experience by joining a society where you can make a real difference in your local community and across the UK. Last year, 2005 STAR students at 39 universities volunteered in their communities, campaigned for refugee rights, and learned about asylum and refugees with experts and peers! http://star-network.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Why-you-should-join-STAR-3.mp4 Here’s what Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre had to say about the STAR students making a difference in their organisation: “I can’t thank the STAR volunteers enough for the amazing work they have done with us this year. They have shown commitment, resilience, curiosity and involvement with and for our young people and the young people really enjoyed their presence. I am looking forward to collaborating again next academic year” – Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre Check out the Student Action for Refugees (STAR) student society at your university – or if there isn’t one, you can set one up ! Don’t just take our word for it – hear more about why you should join STAR from our STAR leaders themselves! “I am so proud to be a member of STAR and am really excited to fight for more social injustices together with my fellow STAR members around the UK!” – Shehany, Plymouth STAR and Equal Access Activist “Volunteering with STAR for the conversation classes, the homework club and the bike scheme is incredibly eye-opening. It is a great way to help refugees and asylum seekers in our local community whilst educating myself on the obstacles they are up against. Therefore, it is both enriching and rewarding and I would recommend it to anyone that has the chance to get involved.” – STAR volunteer at Leeds English conversation club “Volunteering as part of a larger STAR network challenges the idea that your contribution is small. As STAR student leaders, we’re a small cog in a very big wheel making the UK a more welcoming place for refugees.” – Peter, Cardiff STAR “There are many ways to get involved, whether you prefer to interact personally, or to contribute behind the scenes. It’s a great way to better understand the depth of the refugee and asylum-seeking community, past media portrayals and over-simplistic blanket descriptions.” – Jiayi, KCL STAR"
STAR,Good news for refugees wanting to study in the UK,11-Sep-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/09/11/good-news-for-refugees-wanting-to-study-in-the-uk/,"11 September 2023 Student finance rules are changing from 2025. In this blog, you can read about the eligibility of refugees who could not access student finance due to the Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) rule and how STAR and partner organisations have called for the removal of this unfair rule. The government has announced that the restrictive Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) rule will be removed in 2025 when the new Lifelong Loan Entitlement is introduced . What is the ELQ (Equivalent or Lower Qualification) rule? In September 2007, the government announced that it would no longer provide public funding for Home/EU students studying for a qualification that is equivalent to, or of a lower level than, one that the student already holds. This means that if you already have a first degree (e.g. BA, BSc) and wish to study for another undergraduate degree, you cannot currently access a student loan to fund your studies – even if your previous qualification was completed overseas. This rule puts refugees who wish to requalify or need to restart their studies in the UK in a marginalised and disadvantaged position. Case study: A student was trafficked to the UK and this experience influenced her decision to study law in the UK, in the hope that she might one day be able to support other survivors of trafficking. She gained a sanctuary scholarship to study at university in the UK but as soon as she received her refugee status, she was no longer eligible for the scholarship. She was also unable to access student finance as she had a previous degree in literature from her home country. Fortunately, she was able to access private charitable funding to pay her course fees to allow her to continue with her studies, but she has faced intense financial pressure and hardship as she struggles to combine full-time study with working to cover her accommodation and living expenses. What is changing? Last year, STAR, in collaboration with the Refugee Council and Refugee Education UK , wrote to the government about how the ELQ rule has unfairly banned refugees from continuing their studies in the UK by presenting case studies from refugee students who encountered huge barriers to pursuing their education because of this rule. Since refugees come here out of necessity rather than choice, we argued they should be eligible to access funding for their higher education. From 2025, under the Lifelong Loan Entitlement, refugee students will have access to government funding for equivalent qualifications that they already hold. Even though this change will not take place immediately, this is a big step forward, as the rule has had a damaging impact on refugees’ ability to integrate and build new lives here. Removing the ELQ rule will give more refugees the chance to access further and higher education. This will help them gain new skills and qualifications so they can support themselves and have Equal Access to higher education. Their presence at universities also contribute to bringing a more inclusive and diverse environment. There is still work to be done to ensure the new system is fair and accessible. We’ll be monitoring the situation closely with our partners. But this is very welcome news for refugees wanting to study in the UK. We are pleased the government listened to the concerns we jointly raised. Our advocacy was done in partnership with the Refugee Council and Refugee Education UK, which shows the power of collaboration for better change. We also want to show our gratitude to refugee students for sharing their stories with us. To find out more about access to student finance in the UK, check GOV.UK and the UKCISA website."

STAR,Statement on the passage of the Illegal Migration Act,18-Jul-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/07/18/statement-on-the-passage-of-the-illegal-migration-act/,"18 July 2023 The Illegal Migration Bill has completed its final stages in Parliament, and will now become an Act of law. We stand against this cruel attack on the right to seek asylum – and we will continue to fight it. Anyone can become a refugee, and we all have the right to seek sanctuary. Now that the Illegal Migration Bill will pass into law, that basic right will no longer be upheld in the UK. We are not giving up. We will continue to stand up for the right to seek asylum and build a culture of welcome in our communities across the UK. We’ve joined 290 organisations from across civil society to stand against this Illegal Migration Act. JOINT CIVIL SOCIETY STATEMENT ON THE PASSAGE OF THE ILLEGAL MIGRATION ACT As a coalition of 290 organisations representing the human rights, migrants’ rights, refugee and asylum, anti-trafficking, children’s, violence against women and girls, LGBTQI+, disability rights, health, LGBTQI+, housing, racial justice, criminal justice, arts, international development, environment, democracy, pan-equality, faith, access to justice, and other sectors, we condemn the passage of the Illegal Migration Act today, and stand in solidarity with all who will be affected. We all deserve to live safe from harm. But this senselessly cruel Act will have a devastating impact on people’s lives. It turns our country’s back on people seeking safety, blocking them from protection, support, and justice at a time they need it most. In abandoning the UK’s moral and legal obligations, the Act risks breaching multiple international human rights treaties including the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights while shielding the Government from accountability. The UK Government has admitted that it cannot confirm if the Act is compatible with the UK’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act will force people into situations that threaten their lives – whether by placing children in detention or sending people off to countries where their lives might be at grave risk. Moreover, the Act attacks the very core of human rights, which is the principle that we all have them regardless of who we are or where we are from. In stripping the most basic rights from people seeking safety and a better life, the Act dismantles human rights protections for all of us. Either all of us have human rights, or none of us do. While the UK Government’s plans will harm those seeking safety the most, this is an attack on all of us and the values we hold dear. The government has rushed through this law despite broad and deep opposition. But our fight is not over. As caring people, we will continue to fight for the right for people to seek safety and a better life without being forced to take dangerous journeys and without being punished for how they enter the UK. We will keep holding those in power to account for upholding the UK’s international obligations. We will strive for an asylum and immigration system that treats everyone with dignity and respect. We will stand in solidarity with and fight alongside everyone who makes the UK their home and build a society that treats everyone with compassion.

Students, academics and university staff across the UK are taking a stand. Be it the lecturer forced to flee the Taliban, the young woman attacked for defending her rights in Iran, or the student who fled human rights abuses and conscription in Eritrea – under this Bill, people who come to the UK hoping to find sanctuary will be punished and prevented from exercising their fundamental right to seek protection. Act now We know that this legislation does not reflect the views of thousands of students across the country who volunteer and campaign as part of the STAR network, and the staff that support us. We’ve worked with our friends at City of Sanctuary, SolidariTee and the VOICES Network so that you can raise your voice against the Illegal Migration Bill. Help us spread the word We’ll be handing in the petition to Downing Street on Tuesday, and we need your help to reach as many people as possible before then. If you’re in a STAR group, share the petition with your STAR group members Share the link to the petition and explain why it’s important for students to raise their voice: https://bit.ly/unisforrefugees Share the petition on social media Use our social media graphics to spread the word: https://bit.ly/petitiongraphics Share with students, academics, and staff at your uni Reach out to people in your department, other student societies, or university staff that you know. Explain how damaging these laws will be and encourage them to sign the petition and talk about it with their networks too. Contact your MP Write to them by email or ask them for a meeting so that you can explain why you (and the university communities that you are part of) oppose the Bill.

STAR,STAR’s AGM and National Meetup 2023!,29-Jun-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/06/29/stars-agm-and-national-meetup-2023/,"18 February 2023 On February 18th, STAR leaders and Equal Access activists came together in London for our AGM and national meetup – STAR’s first in-person event since 2019. The day was busy, packed with plenty of guest speakers, enriching workshops and networking with people from 17 different STAR groups from across the UK! The day started with networking and icebreakers; STAR members discussed their successes and challenges from the past year, with the former largely outweighing the latter! We also took the opportunity to write some Words of Welcome for people seeking asylum in the UK. #TogetherWithRefugees . The day continued with two thought-provoking workshops: Migrants Rights delivered a Words Matter workshop, which explored the ramifications of how certain language shapes narratives around migration and migratised communities. “It was really useful to think of the impact of our ‘positive’ language, rather than just the explicitly harmful government rhetoric!” Coram Young Citizens presented the impact of the UK asylum system on young people, with speakers from refugee backgrounds sharing their experiences of going through the asylum system as teenagers and young adults. “I really enjoyed getting the chance to hear people’s stories from so close to home + increase our empathy and outlook” Our guests from Ice and Fire theatre acted out Asylum Monologues, a collection of first-hand accounts of asylum seekers’ experiences of the UK asylum system, which left all of us deeply moved. After the performance, some STAR members invited them to perform at their university. “It felt really powerful – humanising stories of the asylum system” During our AGM we celebrated the dedication and achievements of STAR groups, including Bristol STAR who have supported over 100 learners through their conversation classes and Birmingham STAR who have raised over £1500 for STAR National so far this year! From large groups running lots of events, to smaller groups just starting up, we celebrated every STAR leader making a difference and contributing to STAR’s mission of creating a more welcoming place for refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK. STAR groups then voted to elect our newest Student Trustee – congratulations to Shreeja from Bath STAR! To launch STAR’s Campaign Action Week, Campaigns Manager Siobhan presented the focus of this year’s campaign, Lift the Ban , calling for the government to grant refugees the right to work while seeking asylum. STAR groups practised their pitch to convince local businesses to support the High Street challenge , and we ended the day with a photo shoot: attendees wrote down their dream job, which they would not be able to pursue if they were seeking asylum Thank you all for coming to this year’s AGM and meetup! We hope you had a great time meeting fellow STAR members. It was amazing to see STAR groups and Equal Access activists coming together to network and exchange ideas. A huge thank you also to the guest speakers and workshop leaders, we all went away feeling inspired and energised to take action to welcome refugees! See you next year!"
STAR,Refugee Week,13-Jun-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/06/13/refugee-week/,"13th June 2023 Refugee Week and Refugee Festival Scotland are almost here! And I’m sure you’re excited as we are! Refugee Week takes place  from the 19th – 25th June with the theme of COMPASSION and for those of you in Scotland  Refugee Festival Scotland starts a bit  earlier on the 16th – 25th June with the theme of HOPE . The STAR team will be celebrating Refugee Week by traveling around the UK and speaking at a wide range of university events including at the University of Winchester, Birkbeck University, Royal Holloway, University of Edinburgh and University of East London. STAR groups will also get getting involved in their towns and cities. We want to invite you to celebrate hope and compassion with us this June, keep reading to find out how you can get involved. Simple Acts Simple Acts are everyday actions we can all do to stand with refugees and make new connections in our communities.  Here are just a few of the simple acts that STAR National will be getting involved with this year. 1. Walk Together The idea is simple- get a group together and go on a walk together. Wherever you walk and whoever you walk with, you’ll be joining people up and down the country, coming together to create new connections and reflect on the journeys that refugees face. You can walk together whenever you wish – but we are particularly encouraging people to do their walks during the Great Get Together weekend , (23rd- 25th June). You can register your walk with The Great Get Together and use this year’s tool kit ! 2. Use your Platform As a STAR group you have a brilliant platform and a vast network of students. Use Your Platform for Refugee Week to show solidarity and compassion and help shift the narrative around migration and displacement. Here’s some suggestions for how you can use your platform for Refugee Week. 3. Watch a film Is there anything in the world more powerful than a story? Films can be powerful storytelling mediums to take us on journeys without us ever having to leave our seats. At STAR we chose to watch the brilliant MATAR as one of our own simple acts. Directed by Bafta-winning director, Hassan Akkad, MATAR is a powerful and poignant story of resilience and perseverance following the story of an asylum seeker in England. It is based on the lived experience of co-writer Ayman Alhussein. See our film night guide for tips and ideas on how to run a successful film night. If you want any help with this feel free to get in touch by emailing lois@star-network.org.uk If you’ve already seen MATAR, Refugee Week team have compiled a list of other wonderful films and TV shows which help us better understand migration, displacement and help us grow our compassion. Wherever you are this summer there is a huge variety of events for you to get involved with. You can see the full line up for Refugee Week here , and the full line up for Refugee Festival Scotland here , but we want to share with you some of STARs top picks for this June: Visit the Southbank Centre in London any day during Refugee Week and find a range of free and exciting activities.

STAR,"A 1,000 mile journey for STAR!",13-Jun-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/06/13/a-1000-mile-journey-for-star/,"13 June 2023 Cycling from the very south of the UK to the northernmost point is no easy feat. In this blog, former academic Thomas explains why he wanted to take on the Land’s End to John o’ Groats challenge to raise funds for STAR – and what he hopes to see along the way. You can donate and follow his journey on his JustGiving page . It’s often seen as the ultimate cycle challenge in these islands: a journey of almost 1,000 miles from the headland of Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’ Groats in the far north of Scotland. I’m undertaking this challenge to support STAR’s vital work, and to explore new parts of the country in which I have lived for most of my life along the way. Not everybody has the chance to live their life in the place where they were born or of their choosing. I want to support STAR in the work they do extending a welcome to those seeking asylum and refugees. I especially value STAR’s efforts to encourage sponsorship and scholarships within the university sector in this country for those who have had to flee their homelands in the most distressing circumstances. As a former academic, I know how important it is to offer opportunities to continue education among students who have arrived here unexpectedly. I also know that those of us already here also gain so much from such a gesture. We discover the values embedded in other cultures from which we can learn; we come to gain a better understanding of our own place as a country in the world; and we have the opportunity to demonstrate the best that this country can offer to the world. So, for the next three weeks, I will be winding my way up the length of the UK. I’m aiming to finish by the 29th June. You can see my planned route below and follow updates on my JustGiving page .

STAR,Celebrating STARs this Volunteers Week – Jiayi,06-Jun-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/06/06/celebrating-stars-this-volunteers-week-jiayi/,"6th June 2023 For Volunteer Week 2023, we are celebrating STAR volunteers and their contributions. There are thousands of students dedicating their time to make the UK a more welcoming place for refugees and people seeking asylum. In this blog, Jiayi, who is Campaigns Officer for the KCL STAR group, talks to us about her experience at STAR and her involvement in setting up a panel event on the topic of detention centres in the UK. You can find out more about the panel event on STAR KCL’s Instagram page. What is your experience of working with STAR? Volunteering with STAR has been nothing but meaningful – from when I first volunteered at the beginning of 2022 with their University Mentoring Programme to the recently held conference event on the topic of immigrant detention in collaboration with other London universities. Drawing upon my own experiences to guide others where I can in the process of university and scholarship applications, for instance, was eye-opening in foregrounding the disadvantages stacked against individuals who, much like you and me, aspire towards higher education or self-development. The conference was also an amazing opportunity to work with fellow students, from reaching out to insightful speakers to setting up the event venue. It was encouraging to see students from universities across London gather to learn more about the practices that constitute immigrant detention and their consequences, and I was even more heartened when many stayed behind after the panel to talk to the speakers personally. It was also great to receive feedback that the panel was well-rounded and complementary, and that participants left with a deeper understanding of immigrant detention. Why did you want to get involved in creating change? Why not? I believe it’s important to use my privilege to help those who may not have the same advantages. It’s unfair, and frustrating, that some people are forced to leave their homes and seek asylum elsewhere, so if I can make a difference in any small way, I’m happy to do so. I particularly enjoyed volunteering as a mentor: it’s been a fulfilling experience for me because it’s personal. I get to know the mentees, who are in the process of applying for scholarships or courses, just like I did a few years ago. This common ground between us, with such different stories, is one of many examples where change can be worked towards in small steps and through human connection, and further encouraged me to do what I can. How do you think you have made a difference, no matter how big or small? Be it speaking with refugees and people seeking asylum applying to higher education, organising a conference to engage peers, or simply meeting other STAR members at social events, I hope these have been avenues where meaningful interactions have been created. Differences don’t have to be big – if I have just been a friend, that may just be enough. I can only hope the connections made through university mentoring might help mentees on their journey in considering what courses to apply to, or what to include in their personal statement; similarly, I hope that the team’s efforts in hosting the London conference helped raise much-needed experience on the pressing issue of detention. Why should other people get involved in STAR, or in campaigning/volunteering in general? Again, why not? There are many ways to get involved, whether you prefer to interact personally, or to contribute behind the scenes. It’s a great way to better understand the depth of the refugee and asylum-seeking community, past media portrayals and over-simplistic blanket descriptions. On a wider scale, volunteering is empathy and connection; it is seeing someone, however different from ourselves, and showing, in however different ways, that I care for you and I want you to do well. If this is within your capacity, I think it is a wonderful and very worthwhile thing to do. 🙂 If you’re a member of a STAR group, get in touch with our Campaigns Manager Siobhán for advice about planning campaign actions.

STAR,Celebrating STARs this Volunteers Week – Peter,05-Jun-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/06/05/celebrating-stars-this-volunteers-week-peter/,"5th June 2023 For Volunteers Week 2023 , we are celebrating STAR volunteers and their contributions. There are thousands of students dedicating their time to make the UK a more welcoming place for refugees and people seeking asylum. In this blog, Peter talks to us about his experience of running Cardiff STAR’s conversation club, which sees 40-50 participants every week. What is your experience of working with STAR? I’m one of the Conversation Club Coordinators at Cardiff STAR and have been involved for the past 2 years. We run a weekly student-led conversation club with our partner organisation Space4U, which is really well established and has been going for over a decade. Space4U is a great bridge between the community and us as students. It’s been great to have the support of people who have so much insight from previous years but who also want to listen to students’ ideas and let us lead on student-led projects. It was also important for us to use a space that is well known by the community – people know Space4U, know the space, and consider it to be a bit of a hub, a meeting point and a safe space. If you’re setting up a volunteering project for the first time, it’s important you allocate roles. Everyone on the Cardiff STAR committee have their roles and also feed into other things, and for Polly and me, our role as class coordinators is to design weekly prompt sheets, communicate details of the sessions with the learners, and make sure at least one of us is there every week. The prompt sheets we use are only there as a prompt and generally lead to a huge array of discussions, but can be helpful in encouraging conversations with people who haven’t come along before. It’s important to have learners involved in this process – we have topics that they have chosen or suggested that they want to talk about. Before the class starts, people go upstairs and natter away for around 30 minutes. This is something we didn’t do last year and it’s been really lovely to see that happening – it shows that conversation classes aren’t always just sitting at a table learning English in a formal way, it can be having a conversation over a cup of tea. The format of a conversation club can be a new thing for the learners. It’s a much more relaxed environment – it’s not part of an educational institution or studying for a qualification. We’re not teaching English, we’re speaking English. Sometimes the class is over before you know it because the time flies by so quickly! What are some of the highlights of running a conversation club like this? Doing STAR has been a key way of getting away from the ‘student bubble’ and getting involved in my community at a local level. It’s important to connect with other parts of the community, especially with people who have newly arrived to the UK, and STAR is a structured way of doing that. A highlight of volunteering is the friendships you form with other students and learners. Volunteering with refugees helps you get a bigger perspective on life. It’s easy to feel trapped in the stress of university, but going along to the conversation club helps you to understand that there’s so much stuff going on in the world. How can it not impact you? You turn up and they smile and listen to your stories and are worried about how stressed you are about your exams and whether you handed in your essay on time. In my mind it’s extraordinary how people can go beyond their own traumatic experiences and worry and care about students. The structure and support given to us through STAR National, our partner organisation, and the help of STAR’s ESOL consultants gave us the groundwork for a successful project and made us feel comfortable, especially if you haven’t been involved in something like this before. It’s reassuring that we’re not going in blind and that we have the support from people who have done this before. Why did you want to get involved in creating change? I joined STAR just before the invasion of Ukraine. I heard through friends, family and on social media that everyone was feeling so helpless, and like there was nothing they could do. But through STAR, there are ways to get involved. If you’re putting energy into complaining about government policy, or the new home secretary, or other things happening in the world, you can use that energy and put it into creating change in your community. We have a position of privilege as students in that we have spare time. If you want to do something and you have the time, get involved. Speaking English is so important for people who have newly arrived in the UK, or for people who have been here for 10 years and are struggling, and we play a small part in facilitating that skill. We do the conversation club to help people practice their English, but also to help people feel welcome. Why should other people get involved in STAR, or in campaigning/volunteering in general? If you want to get stuck in – do it. Don’t wallow in that feeling of hopelessness, but get out and have conversations with people who are doing things in their community. Volunteering as part of a larger STAR network challenges the idea that your contribution is small. The voluntary sector relies on collective work – if everyone thought that they couldn’t make a difference as an individual, no one would be volunteering. As STAR student leaders, we’re a small cog in a very big wheel making the UK a more welcoming place for refugees.

STAR,Celebrating STARs this Volunteers Week – Shehany,02-Jun-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/06/02/celebrating-stars-this-volunteer-week/,"2nd June 2023 For Volunteer Week 2023, we are celebrating STAR volunteers and their contributions. There are thousands of students dedicating their time to make the UK a more welcoming place for refugees and people seeking asylum. In this blog, Shehany who is the President of Plymouth STAR and an Equal Access Activist talks to us about her experience at STAR. You can find out more about what Plymouth STAR are doing on their Instagram page . What is your experience of working with STAR? I’m Shehany, I’m the President of STAR Plymouth and a STAR Equal Access Activist. I’ve been a volunteer for STAR for just over a year now. A friend and I founded STAR Plymouth last year. I am currently the president of STAR Plymouth. I am proud to share that STAR Plymouth recently won the award for the campaign project of the year and became the runners up for the activity group of the year at the student union awards. STAR Plymouth has volunteered locally, providing opportunities for students to engage and interact with refugees, made over 300 care bags and toiletry packs to be distributed to local families, volunteered at cultural kitchen, provided volunteers for the Plymouth Hope festival, took part, and led refugee week events, provided 1-1 mentoring, and tutoring for young asylum seekers. Recently, we raised over £300 to support local refugee support and legal advice organisations. We have also campaigned heavily over the last year to raise awareness of the barrier’s individuals from sanctuary seeking backgrounds face when it comes to accessing higher education. As an equal access activist for STAR national, I have been helping with campaigning for scholarships, access opportunities at universities across the UK, raising awareness of the issues while calling for policy changes. I recently chaired an online panel event organised by STAR national on “fighting the UK’s anti refugee laws”. This was a platform where students could hear from a panel of experts including refugee sector leaders, campaigners, and politicians about the impact of the anti-refugee laws on people seeking asylum. We also spoke about how we can come together to stand against these unlawful rulings. Why did you want to get involved in creating change? As someone who had to overcome numerous barriers and obstacles to pursue higher education, I understand how difficult it is to persevere when there are so many hurdles in your way, as it is so easy to give up. That is why equal access to higher education is so important to me. I believe there is a significant under-representation of individuals from sanctuary seeking backgrounds in higher education for a variety of reasons, such as issues with their status, lack of student finance access, and a lack of overall support, so I wanted to change that and believe STAR would be a perfect platform to push for this much-needed access. How do you think you have made a difference, no matter how big or small? Nelson Mandela once said, “we can change the world and make it a better place. It is in our hands to make a difference.” Making a difference does not require wealth or influence. Even if you don’t believe it’s feasible, you can already make a difference. All you have to do is give up some of your time and energy! It turns out that many small actions we do in our daily lives have a significant impact that we are unaware of. I believe that by putting myself out there and participating in numerous projects both nationally and locally, I have contributed to a positive change. Why should other people get involved in STAR, or in campaigning/volunteering in general? Equal access to higher education is a human right, and I believe that everyone, regardless of circumstance, has the right to an education. Many people are unaware of the barriers that refugees and asylum seekers face in accessing admission to higher education, as well as the day-to-day obstacles they confront. By getting involved with STAR, you will be given an excellent platform to raise awareness and fight for equal access to higher education for individuals from sanctuary seeking backgrounds. By educating the community and by advocating for their rights, you will be helping them reach for the stars! As an equal access activist group, we have spoken at national and international conferences, provided feedback to institutions such as UCAS, SFE and many more. If you are someone who is a natural leader, then the equal access activist role maybe for you. Being with people who share your interests and hobbies is also incredible. I am so proud to be a member of STAR and is really excited to fight for more social injustices together with my fellow STAR members around the UK!

STAR,How to keep fighting the Refugee Ban Bill,24-May-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/05/24/how-to-keep-fighting-the-refugee-ban-bill/,"24 May 2023 This week, the House of Lords is reviewing government legislation that seeks to ban people from seeking asylum in the UK if they arrive through irregular routes. Read how the STAR network is taking a stand – and how you can get involved. The ‘Illegal Migration’ Bill – also known as the Refugee Ban Bill – is an appalling attack on the right to seek asylum in the UK. If passed, it will strip people of their fundamental human rights and punish desperate people for taking desperate measures to reach safety. The UNHCR has labelled the draft legislation as an “ asylum ban ” and warned that it “ would significantly undermine the international refugee protection system .” STAR stands against the ‘Illegal Migration’ Bill. Our network of students and supporters across the UK want to see a fair, compassionate and effective asylum system that supports people to reach safety and to start participating in the community from day one. Read our full statement on the Bill . As the Bill makes its way through Parliament, STAR groups across the UK have been taking a stand. Stirling STAR’s open letter against the Bill Stirling STAR have collected over 80 signatures from students, academics and local residents who are calling on the government to scrap the ‘Illegal Migration’ Bill. “We started the open letter as we felt that Stirling’s voice needed to be heard and we wanted to take proactive action! Having conversations and starting dialogues when we had a stall in our atrium was a great way of raising awareness.” Read and share the letter Warwick STAR’s demonstration Students at the University of Warwick joined Warwick STAR to voice their opposition to the Bill, right in the heart of their university campus. “Warwick Uni is located very close to Coventry, where lots of refugees are housed, so we think it’s important to inform students that injustices are happening right on our doorstep. We hope to keep up the momentum for the rest of the term, doing all we can to stand up against this government’s cruel legislation!” Edinburgh STAR’s protest art Edinburgh STAR harnessed the power of art to challenge the harmful impact of government policy. They teamed up with Contemporary Art Soc to organise a workshop on protest art and the Illegal Migration Bill. Look out for the artwork in their upcoming zine! WMS STAR’s panel event Warwick Medical School STAR brought together students to learn and share about the impact of UK anti-immigration policies on health. The panel featured a fantastic range of experts from local and national organisations and local MP Zarah Sultana. “It was definitely an eye-opener learning about what is happening to refugees in the UK at the moment, and is a reminder that we all need to advocate for the rights of others.” What else can you do? Contact your MP. Write to them by email or ask them for a meeting so that you (or your STAR group) can explain why you oppose the Bill. This is especially important if your MP has voted in favour of the Bill. You can use Refugee Action’s template email . Sign the pledge to Fight the Anti-Refugee Laws . Your STAR group can sign the pledge to defend the right to seek safety from war and persecution in the UK. You can also call on your local authority to sign the pledge . Raise awareness. Take inspiration from the events above! Get together with your STAR group or others in your community and organise an event to raise awareness about the Bill. This could be a demonstration, an open letter, an arts workshop, a speaker event – or something different. If you’re on a STAR committee, start by holding a meeting with your group to share ideas. Talk to your friends, family, and people in your local community. Keep on spreading the word that this legislation is not who we are . And remember that, if you feel scared and disheartened, you are not alone. We will continue to fight for a fairer future together – and change is possible.

STAR,A warm welcome to Warwick Uni!,12-Apr-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/04/12/a-warm-welcome-to-warwick-uni/,"12 April 2023 As part of our Equal Access campaign , STAR groups organise university open days for refugees and people seeking asylum who are interested in applying for university. In this blog, Hanna from Warwick STAR shares her STAR group’s experience of a recent open day they organised for local families. Hello there, I’m Hanna and I was the Campaigns Coordinator for Warwick STAR this academic year. On Saturday 25 th February 2023, we organised a ‘family open afternoon’ for people within our local area who are from asylum seeking and / or refugee backgrounds. The day was such a success! We were really pleased that 53 adults and 13 children from the local area joined us for a fun day out – including a tour of campus, a refreshing walk, a lovely lunch, and a few games with an educational talk on the options Warwick has for prospective students from diverse backgrounds. How we planned the open day We worked closely with our University’s Widening Participation team to help with the funding of the transport and catering. The organisation of the day was sorted by our helpful STAR executive team. And we had lots of other resources to recommend to attendees and organisers through STAR’s Equal Access campaign and the STAR national team! We made multilingual posters with all the details of the day on them a few months prior, and distributed them to the STAR national team, local organisations, and general Warwick Societies to get as much widespread awareness of the event as possible. We also printed the posters and placed them in the local hotels where we do frequent volunteer sessions of conversational English, and we were able to tell participants to attend and bring their friends! What happened on the day? Coaches picked up our guests from the local Coventry Refugee Centre, Youth Centre, and nearby hotels that we volunteer at. We welcomed our guests at the bus interchange and headed to the lecture room. There was a brief welcome chat, lots of relaxed mingling and games with the children, and we had a filling lunch. We headed on a tour of Warwick’s campus in smaller groups headed by STAR volunteers and STAR Exec members. We had an education talk with the university’s Widening Participation team and input from the youth centre coordinator. Some of us played football and a few outdoor games. What’s next? Going forward, we are planning on doing another open day in October 2023 with a more academic and application focus. And of course, considering the success of this wonderful day, we will be planning many more ‘fun days’ for the local community! You can follow our Instagram to see all of our interesting and diverse events @StarAtWarwick (including other open days). Get in touch with Warwick STAR by email on staratwarwick@gmail.com for any questions, further information or resources. Take care and continue to change the narrative of refugees through STAR at your universities!

STAR,"This Mother’s Day, call on the government to reunite families",17-Mar-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/03/17/this-mothers-day-call-on-the-government-to-reunite-families/,"17 March 2023 For Mother’s day this year, take action with us and call upon the government to put an end to the UK’s unfair Family Reunion rules. While adult refugees are allowed to sponsor some close family members to join them when they arrive in the UK, child refugees are not. Because of these rules, many refugee children will not get to be with their families this Mother’s day. STAR is proud to be a member of the Families Together coalition . Together with over 100 other organisations, we campaign to reunite refugees with their close family whatever their country of origin and background are, reunite child refugees with their parents, expand the definition of family to ensure parents’ safety in the UK, and bring back legal aid for refugees. What the issue is In the last year, over 5000 separated refugee children arrived in the UK alone, unable to reunite with their parents. It doesn’t have to be like this. All of the UK’s closest neighbours allow separated refugee children to sponsor their parents to join them. The situation needs to change and the government can do this with just the stroke of a pen. Children and families will be put at further risk by the new ‘ Illegal Migration’ bill proposed by the government. If the bill passes, people arriving in the UK to seek safety will effectively be unable to have any claim to protection, unless they come to the UK via one of the few, extremely limited resettlement routes. It will allow the government to detain and remove the people arriving through irregular routes, preventing them from reuniting with their families and building a new life in safety. In our letter to Rishi Sunak , which we signed with Refugee Action and over 350 charities, we emphasised that the bill ‘‘makes a mockery of our international commitments” and “shuts the door on desperate people in need of protection” . Refugee children, often suffering trauma from their past experience, need their family’s presence and support. They are now additionally endangered by this new bill. It is urgent, now more than ever, to raise awareness of the situation of refugee children separated from their families. What you can do Write a Mother’s day card in support of #FamiliesTogether and send it to your MP. Tell them why family reunion matters to you. Don’t forget to include your full name and address so they know you’re a constituent. Share your cards on social media with the hashtags #MothersDay and #LetMeBringMyMum, and tag STAR! You can follow the Refugee Council’s guide and template to create your own Mother’s day card. Check out our Instagram post for more information. Sign the digital card and l eave a message in solidarity with separated families. The card will be sent to Robert Jenrick, Minister for Immigration, after Mother’s day – so it’s an important opportunity to show support for family reunion. Sign the digital card here . If you are interested in supporting the Families Together campaign in other ways, or have any questions about it, you can get in touch with Siobhan, STAR’s Campaign Manager ."
STAR,STAR’s response to the Refugee Ban Bill,08-Mar-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/03/08/stars-response-to-the-new-antirefugeebill/,"Published: 8 March 2023 Last updated: 27 March 2023 The Home Secretary has announced an appalling attack on the right to seek asylum in the UK. The so-called ‘Illegal Migration Bill’ will cause harm and suffering for people fleeing war and persecution. If it is allowed to pass, it will strip people of their fundamental human rights and punish desperate people for taking desperate measures to reach safety. This new Refugee Ban Bill will punish Afghans who have fled the Taliban. It will punish protestors who have stood up for women’s rights in Iran. It will punish young men who have fled forced conscription and human rights abuses in Eritrea. It will punish families who have lost everything in Syria. It will punish people who have been unable to access the government’s narrow and restrictive resettlement schemes, and who have no other choice but to reach the UK via irregular routes in order to claim asylum. People who are simply looking for a safe place where they can rebuild their lives. Here’s what we know so far about what is in the the new Bill: The new bill aims to ban people from claiming asylum if they enter the UK through irregular routes. Seeking asylum is a human right. The UK has an obligation under the UN Refugee Convention to give people a fair hearing, regardless of how they arrive. The bill will allow the government to detain people who arrive through irregular routes indefinitely. Immigration detention strips people of their liberty and causes harm to mental and physical health. People should be housed in communities and be able to work while their claims are processed. The Home Secretary will have a new power to deport people “as soon as reasonably practicable.” People will be prevented from re-entering in the future. This is unworkable and impractical. But, like the Rwanda scheme, it will cause fear and distress for refugees. The government will have a new ‘rights brake’, giving them the power to reduce the number of appeals and challenges available to people in detention. The government is not above the law. Legal experts have already expressed concerns that the Bill contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights. Human rights apply to everyone equally – and it is extremely concerning that the government is trying to change that. The government has failed to announce any safe routes. The only way to stop people making desperate journeys across the Channel is to create safe routes for refugees. The majority of people crossing the Channel are granted asylum. There is no refugee visa they can apply for. They can only apply for asylum when they arrive in the UK. If people fleeing war and persecution had a way to reach the UK safely, they wouldn’t have to risk their lives in a small boat. Less than a year since this government passed its cruel Nationality and Borders Act, this new Bill will cause further chaos. It has been widely condemned as unworkable and it will be subject to legal and practical challenges that will delay or prevent its implementation. But the impact of the government’s demonisation of refugees is real and immediate. Recent attacks and protests outside hotels housing people seeking asylum show how dangerous it is when the government uses inflammatory language to whip up anti-migrant sentiment. We know that there is another way. This government must work with its international partners to create a system where refugees do not have to make dangerous journeys. We need a fair, compassionate and effective system that supports people to reach safety and to start participating in the community from day one. We cannot turn our backs on desperate people who are seeking safety. How you can take action Contact your MP . Write a personal letter and ask them to take a stand against the Illegal Migration Bill. The government claims that it is doing what the public wants – show them that they are wrong. It helps if the letter is personal, so explain why this topic matters to you. You can use template emails from Refugee Action and Safe Passage or find your MP’s contact details on the Parliament website . Make sure you include your address so your MP knows that you’re a constituent. You could also ask your MP to meet with your STAR group. For tips on how to talk about the Refugee Ban Bill, read this messaging guide from NEON. Raise your voice. Join the protest in Parliament Square at 6pm on 27th March , or find a local protest near you. You can also sign the petition to oppose the Refugee Ban Bill . Take every opportunity you can to show that you stand against this government’s anti-refugee laws. And remember that you are not alone – the cruelty of the government does not represent the British public. On 18th March, thousands of people joined protests in London, Glasgow and Cardiff to send the message that all refugees are welcome here. Join a group. Show people seeking sanctuary that they are welcome. Find people who are creating change in your local community. If you’re a student, join or set up a STAR group to make a difference to the lives of refugees and people seeking asylum by volunteering in partnership with local organisations and be part of a national network building a society where refugees are welcomed. Your group can also sign the pledge to fight the Anti-Refugee Laws. Don’t give up. If you feel scared and disheartened, you are not alone. But it’s more important than ever for all of us to work together and keep fighting for a fairer future. Talk to friends and family, take time to look after yourself, and remember that change is possible. This Bill does not represent us. Refugees are welcome here."
STAR,Student Volunteering Week 2023: Leeds bike project,14-Feb-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/02/14/student-volunteering-week-2023-leeds-bike-project/,"For Student Volunteering Week 2023, we are celebrating STAR volunteers and their contribution to STAR volunteering projects across the UK. Joe shares his volunteering experience here! Hi, I’m Joe and I’m one of the three coordinators of the Leeds STAR’s bike distribution programme. We collect and refurbish bikes in the Leeds area and donate them to local refugees and people seeking asylum, with the help of local organisations. We see this as really important work because it allows people to regain their freedom, integrate more into their communities, and support refugees and people seeking asylum on extremely low incomes who may not be able to afford public transport. At the beginning of term we used social media and attended our freshers fair to recruit new volunteers, and had a total of 55 applicants – way more than we expected. We’ve run training sessions at the Leeds Bike Mill for new volunteers, and tried to establish a regular group of volunteers who can develop their skills and gain confidence. We’re aiming to run around one or two sessions per week at the Leeds Uni Bike Hub to ensure volunteers get plenty of practice! Leeds Uni Bike Hub had some abandoned bikes that we were able to use to get the project up and running at the start of term, and in the future we intend to use bikes that are donated from people in the local area for refurbishment. Once our volunteers repair the bikes, we work with Leeds-based charity PAFRAS who help us to distribute them to refugees and people seeking asylum in our local community. With support from PAFRAS, so far we have been able to distribute refurbished bikes to 6 people in need! I’ve met a lot of good people through organising the project, and it helps keep my optimism despite the hurdles both we and our recipients are having to overcome. Of course, handing over the bikes is nice too – the recipients are always very grateful because it can really help improve their freedom and mobility. I also help out with the fundraising events that we do from time to time, and with that it’s really cool to see the community coming together to do something positive (and have a good time ). The Leeds STAR Bike Distribution programme relies on donations. If you, or someone you know, would like to donate unused bikes, safety equipment or other donations in reasonable condition in the Leeds area, or if you are a Leeds student and would like to get involved, please get in touch! You can email us at Leeds STAR at staratleeds@gmail.com . Finally, we would like to give thanks to a few people who have really helped in getting our project off the ground – we are so grateful to be able to continue this great work! Leeds Uni Bike Hub, where Roman has helped us immensely PAFRAS, our distribution partners, especially Chris and Ally STAR National charity, especially Emily Leeds Bike Mill CycleNorth"
STAR,Together we can stop the flights,07-Feb-23,https://star-network.org.uk/2023/02/07/together-we-can-stop-the-flights/,"1 February 2023 Last week, STAR UCL and members of the STAR national team participated in the Together With Refugees protest outside of Westminster. We gathered to voice our opposition to the government’s Rwanda Plan and called for it to be scrapped. The Rwanda plan was announced by the government in April 2022. The scheme will see people seeking asylum removed from the UK and sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there. They may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they left in limbo – forced to either find another way to settle in Rwanda or to seek asylum in another country. This plan is cruel and inhumane. Those facing deportation to Rwanda are people fleeing war, violence and persecution, who often simply do not have the option to access safe routes to the UK. Most would be given a refugee status if the UK processed their claims: the Refugee Council found that three quarters of people in a sample of those threatened with being sent to Rwanda have fled countries (Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Sudan and Syria) where 82% or more of people who have sought asylum in the UK have had their refugee status recognised . The UK will be turning its back on people already traumatised – sending them to a country where most do not have any connection, adding to their distress and isolation. This policy will simply not end small boat crossings, it won’t stop people smugglers and it won’t keep refugees safe. In addition, it will come at a huge cost for the taxpayer. That is why we mobilised on Wednesday 25th January to call for the end of the Rwanda plan. We lifted the powerful signs that the Together with Refugees coalition had prepared for the protest: orange hearts, the symbol of the campaign against the Rwanda plan, and our slogan #RefugeesWelcome. The bus journeyed by the Home Office, crossed Lambeth bridge, crossed back on Westminster bridge , and toured Parliament Square and Whitehall.  Along the way, we made sure to voice our opposition by chanting that refugees are welcome in the UK and that the Rwanda plan is cruel and wrong. It was heartwarming to receive support from passersby who cheered for us during the tour. We truly felt the shared passion to stand together to oppose the government’s unjust plan. Thank you to our STAR members who came in support!"
STAR,STAR Christmas events: A time for giving,22-Dec-22,https://star-network.org.uk/2022/12/22/star-christmas-events-a-time-for-giving/,"It’s been a busy few months for STAR as we’ve welcomed 38 student groups to our network, to volunteer, educate and campaign to create a more welcoming society for refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK! Something that is needed more than ever as immigration policy and government rhetoric is becoming increasingly hostile and inhumane. So far this term we have been filling the skies with hope to oppose the cruel Rwanda scheme, fighting the UK’s anti-refugee laws , and campaigning for improved access to higher education in World Access to Higher Education week. STAR groups have been busy getting their volunteering projects started up to give people seeking sanctuary a warm welcome in their local communities and organising loads of events to make sure their fellow students know why the right to refugee protection is so vital, how people are being treated in the UK right now and what needs to change. But with Christmas just around the corner, they’ve also been doing what they can to spread a little festive cheer, positivity and kindness this holiday season. Here are just a few of the excellent things STAR members have been up to! Christmas card fever! Sussex STAR held a holiday card making workshop for people being held in detention centres. The cards were sent to show their solidarity, and let people know that someone is thinking about them this Christmas. The cards were given to LGSMigrants who will be sending them to people in detention centres. “We hope these cards will shine a little bit of hope and light on what is an unimaginably cruel experience that we should be ashamed of allowing people to go through” Winchester STAR have also been spreading positivity through Christmas crafts. The group teamed up with the Winchester Feels society and organised a craft workshop where they created paper flowers and Christmas cards for #Kindnessbypost, a project run by Mental Health Collective to spread goodwill and warmth across the country. It’s not Christmas without a Christmas party Warwick STAR got together to enjoy a delicious Christmas meal and round off the year. The event was a great way for STAR members to come together and celebrate everything that has been achieved by the group over the last three months. The group also organised a secret santa, where STAR members donated Christmas presents to share with the community of refugees and asylum seekers the group supports at their conversation club. Cardiff STAR also held a Christmas party, where the group came together to socialise, have snacks, play games and announce the lucky winners of their raffle. The raffle raised money for their English conversation classes for refugees, and raffle prizes included jewellery, coffee and baked treats from local Cardiff businesses! Gingerbread decorating In Bristol, the group ended the year with a gingerbread decorating and clothes swapping event. Members swapped clothes or donated them to charities that support refugees and people seeking asylum. Bristol STAR will be accepting donations until 22nd December, get in touch with the group to find out more. It’s been a busy and inspiring Christmas for STAR groups, as they continue to fight to make the UK a more welcoming place for refugees and people seeking asylum. As we celebrate the holiday season, we want to showcase and give thanks to all our STAR groups for the incredible work they have done this term.

Racial Justice Network,Exploring Racial Justice: The ‘Rwanda Policy’ Debacle and the Constraints of Our Electoral-Democratic System,22-Nov-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/exploring-racial-justice-the-rwanda-policy-debacle-and-the-constraints-of-our-electoral-democratic-system/,"In this compelling think piece, we delve into the intricacies of the ‘Rwandan Policy,’ a strategic approach employed by the UK government since April 2022 to repatriate individuals who enter the country through ‘unlawful means’ back to Rwanda. This controversial policy, staunchly supported by successive Prime Ministers and Home Secretaries, reflects a persistent effort to deter and prevent individuals from seeking asylum in Britain. As we explore the nuances of this policy, we aim to unravel its implications, ethical considerations, and the broader discourse surrounding immigration and asylum-seeking in the United Kingdom. Background The ‘Rwandan Policy’ refers to the UK government’s strategy for repatriating individuals who enter the UK through ‘unlawful means’ to Rwanda. Since April 2022, the pursuit of preventing individuals from seeking asylum in Britain has been consistently upheld by successive Prime Ministers and Home Secretaries. Supreme Court Rules Rwanda Policy Unlawful Last week, all five judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom were in agreement when they ruled that the government’s ‘Rwanda Policy’ was unlawful. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest authority in legal and public matters, and its interpretation of the law can restrict what the government can and cannot do. Its decisions are informed by precedent, traditions, and current legislation. Only the Parliament in London can challenge its position, as it has the power to pass legislation that could overrule the Courts. What’s happened since? The new UK government has pledged to enact emergency laws to push through the policy, indicating a likelihood of sustained circulation of racist and xenophobic rhetoric against refugees and asylum seekers in the mainstream media. Despite legal and public opposition, the Conservative Party remains committed to this objective, seeing it as aligned with their internal democratic processes. Why is this significant? The Supreme Court’s ruling, while significant in highlighting the government’s actions, may also be deemed relatively insignificant in the broader context. It reflects a recurring pattern where, despite public and legal opposition, the government opts for conservative choices. The historical and contemporary nature of how the Westminster Parliament defines and controls its borders has often involved violence and dehumanisation. What does this mean for democracy? It seems our current options for any next election is a Conservative party trying to outdo itself on racism at every turn, and a Labour party leadership trying to keep up. In either case, the concentration of power in the hands of a few, without popular election or checks and balances, raises concerns about the position of the Prime Minister being able to hold dictatorial power by combining roles afforded to its holder in the government, Parliament, and party dynamics. The competition among a limited group of individuals for this utmost of self-enriching positions is what shapes the future of Britain, with public and judicial influence perceived as secondary in this context. What does this mean for Racial Justice? The historical and contemporary nature of how the Westminster Parliament defines the borders of its control and exercises power over those areas has often involved extensive violence and dehumanisation externally, the mass accumulation of land, rights and opportunities internally, and extreme militarisation, repression, concentrated warfare and surveillance,. Cf. colonisation of Ireland, enclosure, the English-British empire. Contd .. This situation implies that any future government is likely to lead a Parliament that does not aim to distance itself from the legacies of its predecessors. Instead, we can expect the further entrenchment of border violence and the increasingly creative, destructive, and callous leadership for the objective of shaping Britain into an internal fortress, completely militarised both within and without. How do we fix this? There is nothing to fix.  All this simply focuses a lens on what many of us have instinctively concluded. This is not a broken system, but one that is in fact extremely effective at meeting its goals – undermining democracy, personal enrichment, and keeping Britain fascist. The question is not what to fix, but what to break with. Follow Up The history of how Parliament, Party, and Prime Minister emerged as three levers of British power, and the consequences for when they are concentrated or attempted to be, shines a light on how our situation is not new. What do you think about all this? What would you like to learn on these topics? Let us know in the comments. Share this: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp Email Like this: Like Loading...

Racial Justice Network,"Standing in solidarity with our siblings in Palestine, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Yemen, against continued colonisation",16-Nov-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/standing-in-solidarity-with-our-siblings-in-palestine-sudan-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-and-yemen-against-continued-colonisation/,"“I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.” – James Baldwin The many ways in which colonisation is enacted – apartheid, genocide, settler occupation of land, violence, silencing – is nothing new to many of us and our communities. This is especially true for those who have histories of (forced) migration due to the very same powers of colonial domination and violence. We are having to grapple with the maangamizi (annihilation of a people, African holocaust), lack of safety and dignity, and the pain, grief and anguish that comes with being blatantly dehumanised – through the direct experiences of violence and harms, and also through having to minimise ourselves and the ancestral and inter-generational traumas we carry from being subject to colonial exploits around the world. We are also having to endure repeats of many of the global north world leaders who are standing by and either doing nothing or justifying the genocidal actions despite the majority of their citizens calling for action. As we write this, there’s a powerful tool of colonisation at play – evoking our trauma responses to the visceral harms we are witnessing and facing. On the surface level, this might look like a deep fear of getting it wrong (freeze trauma response) or having to ‘pick a side’. With all the best intentions in the world, we play right into the coloniser’s hands by not creating or allowing space for the complexity and nuance of histories of both experiencing and perpetrating harms. So, while imperfect, we are resisting ‘divide and rule’ – the polarisation and weaponisation of us against each other. We are sitting with the pain whilst refusing to stay silent. And we are asking for us to find ways to hold the complexity together but must centre those who are most impacted by these imperialist actions. We stand in solidarity with people who are subject to displacement, apartheid, genocide, ecocide, violence and harm in Palestine, Sudan, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo and others all over the world. We stand with people who are impacted, and others whose religions, identities and lived experiences continue to be used in violent ways to fuel division, war and oppression. As the world witnesses the genocide and apartheid state that has been ongoing and unfolding for decades, as the imperialists, those in most positions of power and the elected fold their arms, justify ongoing actions and vilify those who are speaking up for justice, we call on humanity and the spirit of Umundu (also ubuntu, African philosophy of humanity/human-ness. We call for a ceasefire, Stop the Maangamizi and for a recognition and restoration of people-hood in Palestine and other parts of the world. We also acknowledge the liberatory spirit. We uphold and uplift resistance to oppression in its different manifestations. We acknowledge all who have refused to be bystanders, who have dared to speak up, who have taken action to challenge powers that be and sometimes at a great cost. As Fredrick Douglass said “ Power concedes nothing without demand. It never did and never will” In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground. A time when we have to shed our fear and give hope to each other. That time is now.

Racial Justice Network,Celebrating and Reflecting – International Symposium with Elder Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o,30-Oct-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/celebrating-and-reflecting-international-symposium-with-elder-ngugi-wa-thiongo/,"Dear Racial Justice Network and Community, What an incredible two weeks the 2023 International Symposium was! From October 4th-16th, the Symposium took us to spaces and communities in Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester, where we embarked on a profound exploration of our special guest Professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o’s legacy. The conversations we all shared together connected us to the past, present and futures of international decolonial activism. Through it all, we were honoured to learn from literary giant and advocate for racial justice, Professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, and our delegates from the University of Nairobi, Kenya, and here in the UK during this time. I extend deep gratitude to the community organisers and leaders in these three cities, and scholars from the Universities of Manchester and Sheffield, respectively, for meeting us with trust and hope when we all started project planning together back in June of this year and latter 11th hour support received from equity, diversity and inclusion unit at University of Leeds. Designing and delivering this Symposium together exposed us all to the challenges of organising; magnified by the scale of our plans. The patience, flexibility, efforts, and dedication we applied to our shared vision leaves a lasting imprint of knowledge and inspiration in all our communities, showering us with the joys of organising. I hope that we have all been able to restore ourselves over these two weeks, and look forward to celebrating with everyone in the future. Highlights On October 4th, we welcomed him back to Leeds with a grand ceremony that inaugurated the Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o Freedom Square on our campus, an enduring symbol of his influence. This event not only marked the beginning of our Symposium but also immortalised Professor Ngũgĩ’s impact with a dedicated space on our campus. In Sheffield,October 5th, we enjoyed a traditional Gukunguira reception at utopia theatre, a heartfelt Gikuyu ceremony and homage to Professor Ngũgĩ. It solidified the profound connection he has with our international communities, further emphasising the significance of his work globally. This was followed by a panel discussion at the university of Sheffield on the 6th of October with our international delegation unpacking decolonial principles formulated in Nairobi in 2020 and the meaning of decoloniality today. On the 8th of October, the Gikuyu community in Yorkshire held a reception for mwalimu Ngûgî wa Thiong’o and the rest of the delegation. The community space held discussions, readings and music in the Gikuyu language to acknowledge mwalimu’s life long message and campaign on the importance of mother tongues and retaining native languages as colonial resistance. In Manchester, from October 11th to 13th, we commemorated the historical bonds between Africa and the Diaspora. On the 11th, we engaged in enlightening discussions with members of the Rastafarian community and African Diaspora at the Windrush Centre, celebrating Manchester as a pivotal site of the 1945 Pan-African Conference, a testament to global solidarity and the journey towards independence. On October 12, at Manchester University, we had the privilege of witnessing Professor Ngũgĩ deliver the prestigious Arthur Lewis annual Lecture, hosted by the distinguished journalist Gary Younge and Pan-African Reparationist and Jurisprudent, Esther Stanford-Xosei. This event furthered our understanding of decolonization, reparations, and the future of education. The Symposium reached its zenith on October 16th at Leeds University, as Professor Ngũgĩ delivered a captivating keynote lecture, reflecting on a life’s work that continues to inspire change. Profound impact that University of Leeds had on his consciousness him back in the 1960’s and the global impact that has had in turn. It was a fitting tribute to his incredible journey and enduring commitment to justice. We set off on this international symposium journey with the objective of internationalising and bringing decoloniality back to base, building and strengthening international links and partnerships with the global south and memorialising prof Ngûgî wa Thiong’o physically at Leeds as we celebrate his legacy. We achieved all of this! Key Themes and Takeaways Throughout the Symposium, we delved into crucial themes: Celebrating Legacy: We celebrated and remembered scholar-activists from the Black diaspora, cherishing their legacies as sources of inspiration for present and future generations. Challenging Colonial Norms : Our discussions were a powerful platform for challenging the normalised abnormalities of the global colonial project. It was a clarion call to confront these norms and their lasting effects as we strive for justice. Cognitive Justice: A powerful theme emerged, highlighting the significance of speaking one’s mother tongue as an essential component of cognitive justice. Embracing linguistic diversity was celebrated, while also acknowledging the importance of learning other languages and challenging the dominance of colonial languages. Localising Knowledge: Throughout the Symposium, it was reiterated that knowledge begins with one’s own context and location.It was a reminder that meaningful change and understanding are rooted in acknowledging our unique narratives and the places from which we draw our strength. Engage with Us: Your feedback, reflections, and media from the Symposium are invaluable as we move forward in our commitment to justice. Also scroll through our international symposium gallery On behalf of us at RJN, our fellow organisers, our delegates, guests, and volunteers, I want to express our sincere thanks for joining us in this remarkable journey and share heartfelt celebrations and hope for the reverberating impacts of the 2023 International Decolonisation Symposium not to mention Praela, Heritage corner, African voices Sheffield, Centre for equity and inclusion at University of Sheffield, unit of equity, diversity and inclusion at University of Leeds, department of politics and sociology at University of Manchester.

Racial Justice Network,Press Release – International Symposium,13-Sep-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/press-release-international-symposium/,"RE-MEMBERING OUR ELDERS: NGUGI WA THIONG’O The Racial Justice Network (RJN) is hosting Elder Professor Ngugi wa Thiong’o in a Gukunguira: a celebration of his life and works. During the UK’s African History Month of October, Professor Ngugi will tour cities in the north of England to deepen our knowledge by sharing reflections from a lifetime of boundary-shifting work. He will be accompanied by a delegation of fellow scholars and activists on decolonial and liberatory praxis. He will be honoured and acknowledged as the special guest of this Symposium, as we share the radical impacts of his works. Professor Ngugi’s scholarship powerfully inspires us all with knowledge concerning the decolonisation of the mind and the liberation of cultures from their colonial legacies. Professor Ngugi is a giant of the Pan-Africanist movements for the Liberation of the human mind and consciousness and for pointing out the inconsistencies within language colonisation and what he refers to as ‘normalised abnormalities’. He has done so through producing works which span more than seven decades and an equal number of continents. Professor Ngugi has authored 34 books, given countless talks and webinars, lectures and presentations on the subject of decolonisation, language and cultural liberation. During a career that has featured in numerous films and documentaries, has received multiple awards, honorary positions and recognitions internationally. The Professor will be accompanied by a party of scholars and educators from the University of Nairobi, as well as Kenyan community activists together with Pan-Africanist campaigners and educators from the UK. The group will tour three UK universities and community spaces in the North of England, namely: Leeds University (tbc) (his alma mater in the UK); Sheffield University and Manchester University on the dates given below, between the 3rd and the 18th of October, 2023. Part of the rationale behind the Symposium is to continue the community education and pedagogical encounters held in Nairobi in January 2020, in collaboration between the Racial Justice Network, the University of Manchester and University of Nairobi on the theme of decolonising education. Alongside others, critical were the principles of decolonial practice that emerged from that work, which we wish to deepen and enlarge upon. ● The Racial Justice Network, led by its Chief Executive Officer, Peninah Wangari-J, will, on the 4th of October, 2023, receive and lead an opening tour of the Professor to the location of his alma mater, Leeds University, after visiting the RJN offices nearby. He will deliver a short address to those who are gathered to stimulate a lively conversation in remembrance of his time in Leeds, both at the University and where he lived in Chapeltown, Leeds. ● Between the 5th and 6th of October, 2023 Sheffield University have organised for the Professor to grace the Utopia Theatre on the 5th of October, 2023, where the Gukunguira, the traditional reception of honouring and acknowledgement, will be performed, held by members of the delegation. He will be regaled by a selection of the community familiar with his life and works and offer a short speech in acknowledgement of the same. The 6th October will see a hosting of a conversation with the delegation. ● The delegation will be in Manchester between the 11-13th of October, 2023. The 11th October will see the Professor and members of the delegation hold audience with members of the Rastafarian community and African Diaspora at the West Indian Centre in Moss Side, acknowledging Manchester to be the site of the 1945 Pan-African Conference, which was an international meeting of minds in critical conversation and movements of solidarity heralding the gathering motion towards independence across the colonised world. ● On the following day the respected journalist Gary Younge and Pan-African Reparationist and Jurisprudent, Esther Stanford-Xosei, will be holding space for Professor Ngugi in Manchester University for his delivery of the prestigious Arthur Lewis annual Lecture on October 12 at 6pm in University Place Lecture Theatre. There will also be discussions on the following day continuing relations between the members of the Kenyan delegation and the university and the work of decolonisation, reparation and educational futures as part of the ongoing exchange between RJN and its global relations on these subjects. ● Finally on the 16th October, 2023, the Professor will deliver a Keynote lecture at the University of Leeds (TBC), which will include leading a special panel in a roundtable discussion. This will be a public lecture and discussion, which requires advance booking. It will serve to commemorate his life and work which arose from a place that was incredibly formative and impactful on his path, launching a lifelong commitment to cognitive and decolonial praxis. An abbreviated Bio of Professor Ngugi wa Thiong’o: Ngugi was born in Kamirithu near Limuru, in 1938, in the ‘white’ highlands of Kenya, the heart of the colonised landscape. The colonial regime shaped his family’s life: one brother joined and died fighting in the Gĩkũyũ Land and Freedom army and the other was shot, point blank by colonial police as a result of his disability. These and other events of his life: studies at Makerere University and education by missionaries shaped his thinking throughout his studies and his writings as James Ngugi, as he communicated his insights through his early writing in English. In particular ‘Weep Not Child’(1964) and ‘The River Between’ (1965) which explored his colonial childhood. All of this intensified after his studies at Leeds University, where his encounters with Fanon’s writings and studies of George Lamming reactivated his commitment to the role of writing for his people and at the final stages of his dissertation, decided to recommit to his decolonial mission by writing ‘A Grain of Wheat’ (1967) which brought him back into prominence as a decolonial scholar. He returned to Kenya and in the early 70’s, he went on to denounce his colonised Christian name reclaiming his Gĩkũyũ name as Ngugi wa Thiong’o – recognising his father and embracing his cultural roots by subsequently deciding to write in the language into which he was born: Gĩkũyũ. As a writer featured in school curricula and a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, Ngugi’s grassroots activities in the arts, and agitating for changes in the literature department led to him becoming hounded by and finally arrested by the Kenyan government of the 70’s and spending a year in prison. He continued to write in his own tongue and ‘Petals of Blood’ and ‘Devil on the Cross’ were released during that period. Upon release from prison he and his family’s hostile experiences led him to exile in London, then Stockholm and later the United States where, after professorships at Yale, at New York University, periods of activism spent in South Africa and speaking tours in Asia, he eventually took up residency as professor at the University of California, Irvine, up until recently. Professor Ngugi has received many distinguished awards, honorary doctorates and prizes between 1964 and 2022, acknowledging his unrelenting campaign against ‘normalised abnormalities’ resulting from colonisation. He is one of the few remaining scholars and activists whose work defines the grand eras of decolonisation of the African and global diasporic mind and we celebrate and honour his life’s work in Gukunguira. His works include essays, plays, memoirs and fiction, a selection of which are: Homecoming: Essays on African and Caribbean Literature, Culture, and Politics (1972), Writers in Politics: Essays (1981) Education for a National Culture (1981), Barrel of a Pen: Resistance to Repression in Neo-Colonial Kenya (1983), Globalectics: Theory and the Politics of Knowing (2012), In the Name of the Mother: Reflections on Writers and Empire (2013) and Secure the Base (2016) The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (1976) and Ngaahika Ndeenda Ithaako ria ngerekano (I Will Marry When I Want (1977). Detained: A Writer’s Prison Diary (1981) Dreams in a Time of War: a Childhood Memoir (2010), In the House of the Interpreter: A Memoir (2012).

Racial Justice Network,URC Reflections: Wealth Distribution,08-Sep-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/urc-reflections-wealth-distribution/,"URC Reflections: Wealth Distribution An important aspect of the Unlearning Racism journey has been our continued reckoning with the deep-rooted racial injustices tied to the legacy of colonialism, and imperialism exported by the British Empire. These injustices manifest themselves in different ways, notably with the global system of capitalism and wealth accumulation which leaves a violent chasm between those with access to resources and those at the brutal edge of insidious wealth disparities. To combat this deeply entrenched imbalance, a paradigm shift is essential—a radical redistribution of wealth from an internationalist racial justice perspective. We must delve into both the historic economic injustices and present realities faced by the global majority to begin our repairs and initiate these crucial conversations. We must shatter the narrow confines of merely acknowledging the wealth gap in the UK and confront the stark reality of the countless lives that have been entrapped in the grip of coloniality’s enduring legacy. In this blog, we delve into radical wealth redistribution and share our experiences with the Unlearning Racism Course. Through real applications and insights from a former participant, Katherine Wall, we highlight the potential for collective action and transformative change. Unlearning Racism x Wealth Distribution In early February, I attended a weekend-long course organised by the Unlearning Racism Collective (URC), part of the Racial Justice Network . The arc of this course took us through the histories of how racism and whiteness came into being shaped by the forces of capitalism and the pursuit of profit through exploitation, extraction, and violence. The facilitators supported us – a group of white-bodied people – to look at how racism shows up in our lives and bodies, and how it feels to know that we are both shaped by systems of racism and uphold them even while we want to dismantle them. We looked at interventions we could make, ways to show up in solidarity with Black and Brown people, and how we could remain accountable for any actions we take. One of the most powerful parts of URC was when we turned our attention to material wealth and redistribution as part of racial justice work for white people. I had experienced something similar in workshops about class – from The Class Work Project and Resource Justice – but this was the first time I had experienced this demand for redistribution within an unlearning racism course. Grace Deione, URC facilitator - shared her money story A money story is when a person names, with numbers, what they have – in their bank account, in terms of Savings, Housing, or Inheritance. It can include a person’s class background and present class experience. And it can relate to how whiteness has shaped their access to material privilege. Hearing this from Grace, and her reflections on what redistribution of resources she had undertaken, then opened up a conversation for us  as participants to reflect on our own access to material wealth and how we could also redistribute some of it, especially to Black and Brown-led groups. We were invited to think through groups we had a relationship with already or groups we know of that we could connect with and were invited to pledge to these groups. To ask about resource needs, as well as to pledge to give money/time if that was wanted or needed. For accountability, we were invited to fill in a form to name the groups and the amounts that we would be reminded of by the facilitators in several weeks’ time. There are questions for me within this approach about where the power sits regarding who decides where the money/time goes – currently, it still sits with the white person with wealth. And I am interested in how to shift that power towards the communities that need the money – in ways organisations like Edge Fund , Bristol Redistro and the JRCT Movement Fund are trying to do. We encourage you to explore the following resources that have significantly influenced our thinking and understanding of wealth accumulation, reparatory justice, and organising for racial justice. We would like to acknowledge the teachings, wisdom, and phenomenal work of: Esther Stanford Xosei and the Stop The Maangamizi campaign. Check out Esther’s talk with the URC on some of the foundations of reparatory justice here . Resource Generation and their UK counterpart Resource Justice , creating a community of progressive people in the UK committed to the equitable distribution of wealth, land, and power. Class Work Project , a worker’s co-op educating and organising around class identity, stigma, experience and oppression. Check out the Lumpen publication, Tracksuits, Traumas & Class Traitors which is available to purchase with both a regular and solidarity fee. Decolonising Economics , working to build a solidarity economy rooted in racial justice principles based on Movement Generation’s framework for a Just Transition. The Good Ancestor Movement supports individuals and organisations with responsible wealth stewardship and radical redistribution. We ask all readers, to give genuine consideration to their immense potential of wealth redistribution. The time has come to confront the harsh realities of economic disparity and its deeply rooted connection to racial injustice. Our commitment to this work matters to challenge the narrative of scarcity in a world in which hoarding is normalised.

Racial Justice Network,Stop The Data Discrimination:,04-Jul-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/stop-the-data-discrimination/,"Digital Hostile Environments and The Dangers of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. The Hostile Environment is propped up by a vast infrastructure of surveillance, and its tactics of fear and intimidation are increasingly digitised. Now, the Home Office has announced plans to operate a “fully digital system” for all migrants by 2024. To make matters worse, they are trying to push through a Bill that could strengthen the Hostile Environment’s data-sharing practice and make them harder to challenge. Across some spheres of the internet and media, ‘The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill’ (DPDI), has been uncritically represented as aiming to enhance data protection practices and ensure the responsible handling of personal information. In reality, it removes protections that will affect us all and makes it harder to scrutinize and challenge data injustice. Not only does it loosen regulations around the kind of sharing and re-sharing of data that has been central to the Hostile Environment, but it also directly undermines the legal channels that allow individuals and organisations to hold state authorities and private corporations to account. We are asking organisations and individuals to: Resist data injustice in the DPDI Bill with the Open Rights Group’s campaign pack ; Resist the digital hostile environments the Bill emboldens by supporting or getting involved with the ‘Stop the Scan’ campaign. To gain a comprehensive understanding, we recommend reading further to explore the dangers posed by the DPDI Bill and its potential impact on Digital Hostile Environments. Additionally, for a more detailed explanation of the actions discussed, please scroll down to the bottom of this blog where you will find further information. To learn more about the implications of the DPDI Bill on Digital Hostile Environments, continue reading before checking the bottom of this blog for additional information on the mentioned actions. Digital Hostile Environments The Open Rights Group has undertaken significant efforts to bring attention to the alarming aspects of the DPDI Bill. Through their ‘Stop the Data Discrimination’ campaign, they actively oppose the Bill’s erosion of data protection rights, the unregulated authority it bestows upon governments and corporations, and its facilitation of data discrimination through biased algorithms that harm marginalised individuals and groups further marginalised by society. At the Stop the Scan, we understand how vital this protest is. Strong data protection in the UK is a critical line of defense against government overreach and the continued weaponisation of technology against racialised and migrant communities. © Carson McDowell We believe that the data rights of racialised and migrant communities are already inadequately protected. The data-sharing practices of the Hostile Environment are intrinsically unfair and have had  terrible consequences. People are forced to navigate a system where every move may be scrutinised and where your data can be weaponized against you when accessing essential services like healthcare, education and housing.This data sharing enables aggressive immigration enforcement, resulting in detentions, deportations, and family separation. To make matters worse, the Data Protection Act 2018 empowered the Home Office and private companies to reject individuals’ requests for accessing their personal data for “the maintenance of effective immigration control.” As a consequence, migrants can be unjustly denied the ability to obtain and review information about themselves, hindering their capacity to address inaccuracies, challenge decisions, or seek appropriate legal recourse. This exemption perpetuates an unjust culture of barring migrants from access to their full rights. We see the culture’s ramifications with the handheld fingerprint scanners, notably piloted in the same year as the immigration control exemption came into force. Police officers can use mobile fingerprint scanners to remotely check a person’s fingerprint against immigration and law enforcement databases. This can happen in any public space – such roadsides, streets, parks and public events – and result in arrest or detention. As our report series shows, this does not keep our communities safe but subjects people to harassment, and fear-mongering tactics. Furthermore, mistakes have consistently been found in migration information putting people being stopped and scanned in very vulnerable situations. Migrants deserve better data protection, and there is an urgent need to repair an unjust system and defend the rights already in place. We need robust laws that protect the data rights of all humans, and that provide us with the tools to challenge the data injustice we see take place. Instead, the DPDI bill moves us in the opposite direction. If passed, the DPDI bill would gravely weaken the UK’s data protection framework. It waters down data subjects rights and empowers the Secretary of State with new undemocratic controls over data. To help illustrate the dangers posed,  The Open Rights Group has provided the below information to Stop the Scan in order to help us understand how all of these changes would impact police use of mobile biometrics and the resulting data. Read on to find out more. DPDI Bill Impact New exemptions for “national security” and “crime prevention”: The DPDI Bill has added new exemptions for re-sharing data without consent, including vaguely defined purposes like “national security” and “crime prevention”. This would allow data collected in a ‘stop and scan’ to be re-shared more easily, and make it harder to challenge the government’s retention and re-purposing of data. Changes to Chapter 3 Data Subjects Rights: The Bill will create a new barrier for individuals attempting to exercise their basic rights over their own data e.g. Right of access, Right to erasure, Right to object to processing. It allows data controllers to refuse the exercise of such rights where the exercise is ‘vexatious or excessive’. This will impact organisations and individuals attempting to understand or challenge how their data has been collected and shared through police mobile biometric collection. Changes to international data transfers: The Bill empowers the Secretary of State to approve international data transfers with little regard to the existence of enforceable rights and effective remedies. This could allow transfers to countries where data protection is limited. Various national security and law enforcement bodies within the UK could also more easily re-share data with national security bodies in other countries. Changes to Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs): Data Protection Impact Assessments require the government and businesses to analyse, identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project or plan before undertaking it. They are especially important in cases where the data being processed is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals (like police biometrics programmes). Despite this, the bill makes changes to DPIAs, reducing the requirements to conduct one before processing people’s data and removing the requirement to consult with individuals who might be impacted by the use of their data. It is critical to hear from individuals themselves about how the use of their data could negatively impact them. A loss of proper DPIAs also makes it harder to scrutinise proposed systems. While it is unclear whether the new bill would mean that police departments no longer have to conduct an impact assessment at all, departments would no longer be required to consult with individuals who would be impacted by the processing. Call to Action What we are witnessing right now is a nexus of data discrimination snowballing with the constant introduction of more and more surveillance technologies – the fingerprint scanners and facial recognition apps; the 24/7 GPS tagging of migrants; “predictive” systems in the policing and criminal justice system; police use of live facial recognition at public events and calls for it to be embedded in body-worn cameras. This nexus will be emboldened if Bills such as the DPDI pass unchallenged and directly undermine data rights and the legal ability to seek data justice. So, how can we stop this happening? Whether you’re an organisation or individual, The Open Rights Group has several options on how you can help challenge the DPDI bill here . In particular, check out their “ Take action with our campaign pack ” – a toolkit for stopping the data discrimination bill. At Stop the Scan we have consistently demanded that the scanners be removed – with the installation of a firewall between the Home Office and services like the police and the NHS. We have also made a number of other demands and recommendations, such as the removal of the immigration control exemption in the Data Protection Act 2018. Please read our reports to find out more and share them with your networks. If you are interested in taking action with the Stop the Scan campaign, please email stopthescan@racialjusticenetwork.co.uk – We are always looking for new people to get involved, whether in small or big ways, so get in touch if you want to be involved in any upcoming actions! You can also email Stop the Scan to request physical copies of our reports and flyers to distribute in your communities. Please also take the time to check out our website, which includes a “Know Your Rights” section designed to empower people to know their rights when they have been stopped and scanned.

Racial Justice Network,Reflections on Unlearning Racism,17-May-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/reflections-on-unlearning-racism/,"By Maia Kelly As we approach the next annual cycle of Unlearning Courses, we will be continuing to trial and evaluate more approaches to improving the impact of the work. The ways forward we are trialling do not mitigate all inherent risks associated with this work, but we will continue to be transparent about our backtracking, growth, and attempts to repair as we fumble forward. A key takeaway from this unlearning journey has been how accountability is a constant process. Deepening trust and relationships through showing up, deep listening, doing what we say we’ll do, not repeating harms when we mess up – are essential parts of serving our shared mission of ending racial injustice. Part of our work within the Unlearning Racism Programme (URC) is to continue to evaluate, learn and strengthen . Being transparent about our backtracking and re-strategising whilst sharing our unlearning journey as a project is part of our accountability to those who experience racial marginalisation, and entrust us to do this work alongside them, as part of our shared vision for collective liberation. We want to acknowledge the reputational and organisational risks that the Racial Justice Network takes in hosting the URC Programme. Over the years of coordinating this project, we have welcomed critical feedback and sat with the pitfalls, tensions and contradictions we hold in doing anti-racist education as white-facilitators. Some publicly available critiques around white people educating and organising for racial justice that have influenced us includes; Rachel Ricketts’ ‘ White Women Ain’t Fragile (Nor is White Supremacy) ‘ DiDi Delgado’s ‘Whites Only: SURJ And The Caucasian Invasion Of Racial Justice Spaces’ Ambalavaner Sivanandan’s ‘Communities of Resistance: Writings on Black Struggles for Socialism’ Among other tensions, their critiques highlight the tendencies for; Many white people to prefer learning about white supremacy from other white people instead of from those who experience racial marginalisation – which is white supremacy continuing to limit the success of Black and Brown anti-racist educators; For whiteness and the white-gaze to perpetuate white supremacy, superiority, entitlement and white comfort – which inevitably permeates white caucused spaces, and risks white-washing or minimising the relenting harm that white supremacy inflicts; For white anti-racism spaces to risk becoming ‘safety nets’, that protect white people from the uncertainty, risks, and fears of failure – which both keeps those with lived experience at a distance, limits relationship building and building an anti-racist practice through doing. DiDi Delgado’s article highlights the crux of white-anti-racist work being about being in true accountability , not leading the work in isolation. ‘The objective for allies should be to inflict as little harm as possible. And the way to do this is through accountability. But who are white-led anti-racism groups accountable to? And what does that accountability look like?’ As URC is a white-identifying space, it is essential to continually ask ourselves these questions. How accountable is our work? How effective is it in meaningfully contributing to movements for racial justice? And are we meeting our purpose of ‘supporting and mobilising for Black and Brown-led anti-racist work’? 2021 Following strategic conversations with Mentors within the Racial Justice Network, we trialled new approaches in our organising work as discussed in our blog post on white accountable action. Central to these earlier revisions of the course was the recognition that it was not enough, and even harmful, for white people to learn about how racism and white supremacy operate but stop there. We realised that the efforts of URC were inherently flawed if we were not going further, and engaging white folks in taking accountable action in support of racial justice. In response to these discussions, the changes made in 2021 were; Movement Mentors – To resource movement mentors to offer guidance to facilitators, as well as in depth sessions with course participants to centre their grassroots organising within the course, guide opportunities for action and shared requests with us that might support their work, and wider movements for racial justice; Accountable Action Group – To set up a white ‘Accountable Action Group’ (inspired by the Showing Up For Racial Justice organising model in the States) to be responsive to the needs of grassroots campaigns when opportunities for mobilisation or targeted action arose (guided by the Racial Justice Network, Mentors and other grassroots groups in our networks). Financial Redistribution – Further embed a financial model based on redistribution of income generated through course fees: where 50% of income covers running costs and mentor remuneration, and the other 50% is allocated towards resourcing campaigns and projects within RJN. Despite these interventions, there was still a low uptake of Mentor requests, and limited evidence of collective action. This was not least due to how our whiteness showed up in our organising practices through: prioritising outputs over relationship building with Mentors; lacking flexibility to resource emerging needs and creative ideas when these arose; failing to give direct feedback or say no when asks weren’t possible, under-communicating boundaries and needs both as individuals and as a collective. The combination of these factors alongside structural factors such as siloed meetings, and underestimating time, limited our ability to deepen personal relationships and work in community towards co-liberation. One comment that particularly stood out in the annual project evaluation was that; ‘The learning happens in caucused spaces and action happens in community’. – Penninah Wangari-Jones This highlighted how counterproductive it was to host a caucused white ‘Accountable Action Group’. We wasn’t seeing actions emerging from this space because it inadvertently prioritised time in white spaces over building trust and relationships with Black and Brown organisers in lived experience-led spaces. 2022 In response to feedback received over these recent iterations of the course, we’ve continued to adjust our approach further in efforts to see more energy going into supporting campaigns and projects organising for racial justice following the courses. The changes made in 2022 were; New Content on Accountability & Redistribution – Bringing more action oriented content into the course. This was done by streamlining the current content, and adding two new modules focused on solidarity, relationship building, accountability and wealth redistribution to the course. Practical Tasks – Encouraging a participatory process of action learning throughout the course, by cutting back on content and reading materials, to give more time to action, practice and organising. The new modules included practical fundraising, donating, research and action tasks between sessions. Clearer Purpose – Making effort to better emphasise our purpose and what the course is for in our publicity, to attract those who share our vision, and are interested in lifelong unlearning and solidarity. Less Silos, More Solidarity – Presenting requests and opportunities for action upfront in courses and communications with participants beyond the course, to create easier pathways into Racial Justice Networks campaigns (because ‘action happens in community’ ). Action Learning – Continuing to offer a monthly peer support space, but ensure it is not a forum for action, but explicitly for reflecting on our practice ( ‘ the learning happens in caucused spaces’ ). This functions to build more accountability to each other, and receiving support and challenge in how we apply the learning to prevent drop-off or harmful application. Acknowledgements We would like to acknowledge the teachings and wisdom of our Mentors and colleagues Peninah Wangari-Jones, Esther Stanford Xosei, Mama D Ujuaje, Anu Priya, Melany Zarate, Sarai Pinney and Viriginie Assal, as well as former Trustees Maureen Grant, Sai Murray, Richard Traviner and Remi Joseph-Salisbury who gave shape the work in its earliest iterations in 2017-19. Without their generous feedback and insights – recognising where the project falls short of its goals, as well as shining light on potential ways forward for us to explore – this work would absolutely not be possible. We are incredibly thankful for the trust and honesty to share these truths, visions and ideas.

Racial Justice Network,The Bounce Back: Storytelling as a Form of Resilience,10-May-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/the-bounce-back-storytelling-as-a-form-of-resilience/,"By Naava Abigail Busenze Balagadde Resilience noun noun: resiliency ; plural noun: resiliencies Comes from the Latin word ‘resilio’ meaning ‘to bounce back’. The successful adaptation to challenging life experiences (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004). “Until the lion tells the story, the hunter will always be the hero.” Ewe-mina Proverb Research continues to reiterate that trauma can separate and weaken a community, however, it cannot disregard that it can also unite and strengthen through resilience. Resilience is the ability to cope with the stressors of life and is the maintenance of homeostasis, also known as the equilibrium or balance in which one can adapt to the challenges in life. Exposure to trauma, regardless of how big or small you may think it is, can cause interference in one’s life routine that demands this. Resilience can be understood through three different definitions: Trait resilience focuses on the individual’s ability to cope with adversity with successful development. Outcome defined resilience is measured by the achievement of socially desirable outcomes, such as educational achievement or good cognitive functioning. The process focused approach considers resilience as one’s ability to recover and adapt to adverse life events. Regardless of the definitions, resilience can result in becoming more empathetic and adaptable, acquiring the essence of Ubuntu. This is the true essence of humanity, defined as ‘I am because we are’ amongst the Bantu people of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa. The 13th recommendation , coined by the Racial Justice Network, holds this truth as it acknowledges that we cannot combat a situation individually without considering the impact it has on the collective (RJN, 2020). It insinuates that life’s challenges are not experienced alone, but as trauma can be inherited, so can resilience. One way of inheriting resilience is through the art form of storytelling . I have been journaling since I was 10 years old, writing down my stories to bring out what was in my mind into physical form. I believe that my journaling practice emulates, if not, is a form of storytelling – whether there is an audience or not. Journaling is the most vulnerable and emotionally intimate experience I have had with myself. It has allowed me to express any traumas I may have experienced and become a path for healing I could provide for myself when professional help may not have been accessible. I have researched why that is. Why is writing down how I feel so important to me? Why is it so healing for me to storytelling even when there is no audience? How does storytelling involve the 13th recommendation? And how does storytelling have an impact on the community? I personally believe that resilience should also be defined through storytelling as not only does it facilitate an understanding of human behaviour, but it is also a tool to resist oppression. Storytelling is a rich tradition that can be experienced from music and dancing to the talking drum and plants in indigenous communities; as well as the general oral or written recital of a narrative. It is very common within African cultures to communicate through storytelling to share, warn and teach across generations. Storytelling as an agent of resilience has the ability to foster effective healing , spiritual communion and build a sense of community. This can also be explained through the social change ecosystem framework created by Deepa Iyer: When an individual or community experiences psychological impact such as racial trauma across generations, it can devalue their sense of self and erode the relationship within the community. This is where storytelling becomes an integral part of harbouring resilience by restoring cultural identities. Storytelling can be seen as “counter-hegemonic stories”  meaning it has the ability to dismantle the negative narrative posed on oppressed groups. An important aspect of resilience is the access to social connections. Ubuntu states that one cannot understand the self as an individual but within a community. This can be seen in an Ethiopian study that looked into storytelling in music and inter-generational healing in Oromia. They analysed interviews of Ethiopians within different generations and found that music was a form of storytelling that provided reconciliation and peaceful coexistence across the generations, essential for resilience. The music was storytelling used within groups to create resilience to resist the adversity faced by both the individual and the community. Additionally, the Afro-centric perspective recognises the importance of collectivism in resilience and holds an emphasis on community healing. To meet human needs, the community creates opportunities in order to achieve what would be difficult to achieve alone with upholding commitments such as unity, trust, love, uplifting elders who are the collective memory of the community and respect for nature. This has been developed in a framework known as Community Healing and Resistance Through Storytelling. This looks beyond the individualistic approach centering the community to help heal the individual. The three major components of this framework are: Social change values, individual roles, and the broader ecosystem. Deepa Iyer Justice focusing on being both the outcome of and condition of community healing. Cultural syntonic processes are the drawing of relationships between abstract ideas and cultural acts. An example of this would be storytelling as it aims to create a new narrative for the trauma experience as well as bring ideas into action (Burkett, 2017). Connectedness, Collective Memory, and Critical consciousness . These are the three key psychological dimensions to which storytelling provides a connection between the individuals within the community to establish healing and resilience from the adversity faced . A cognitive map is provided by the collective memory obtained through storytelling to help re-examine the individual’s ways of being and behavioural patterns that could guide community healing. The C-HeARTS narrative therapy ensures that you are sharing your personal story with others to facilitate the reframing of what once was a negative cognitive state to a more positive state, achieving resilience. I personally find storytelling through journaling incredibly helpful for me to re-narrate my experiences and thought processes which I share in my workshops . Storytelling is an integral part of many communities since it harbours healing properties that provide catharsis. It disrupts the erasure of resilience by reminding those of their stories to find strength, to warn and to teach.  Just as trauma can be inherited, so can resilience.

Racial Justice Network,Resisting The Migration Bill,25-Apr-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/resisting-the-migration-bill/,"By Carys Coleman When will this raft of anti-migration, and fundamentally anti-human, legislation end? How has cruelty and ignorance of this degree been allowed to continue? Little over a year ago, RJN and Yorkshire Resists wrote about the sustained attack on human rights marked by the Nationality and Borders Act. Alongside countless others, we decried the cruelty of measures that created even more obstacles and harms to people seeking asylum; created routes of unsafety; and increased arbitrary procedural demands that push people into undocumented status. Now we face yet another piece of draconian legislation – the ‘Illegal Migration Bill’ (sometimes referred to as the ‘small boats’ bill).  Under the new law, anyone who arrives in the UK through a so-called “irregular” route, such as via a small boat or lorry, will have their claim deemed “inadmissible”. This means the Home Office will refuse to even consider their claim for asylum. Instead, they will be detained for 28 days and deported. The violences here are innumerable. From the outset, the Bill perpetrates a vicious cycle of denial. It tramples on the fundamental human right to seek asylum and subjects many more to the violence of deportation, without even a “fair hearing”. Even the UNHCR, who rarely make very critical statements, have denounced the Bill for effectively banning asylum. What the government has called “irregular” routes are for so many the only option, not least because the government has created a border system in which safe entry is all but impossible. The Bill will also worsen the cycle of re-traumatisation within the UK’s detention system. For decades, refugees have been protesting their inhumane conditions and speaking about the trauma caused by locking people up. The Bill means even more will be treated this way, and for far longer than the claimed 28 days of detention. It is predicted that the Home Office will be unable to carry through their unlawful deportation plans but will refuse to process asylum claims, leaving tens of thousands without access to support, work or humane living conditions. To make matters worse, the government plans to use army barracks and floating barges for detention as a twisted solution. We know that, in too many ways, the cruelty of this Bill is not unprecedented. Its seeds were sown in a hostile environment that never went away but was allowed to take root and grow borders through the streets we walk down, the schools and workplaces we attend, the places we live, and the hospitals and public services that were supposed to care for community. It re-deploys the racist attitudes and imperial technologies that draw up borders and separate humanity into false categories of deserving and undeserving. It is grounded in the deeply colonial claim to know the truth of who belongs where in which land. In other words, the cruelty of this present is rooted in the reality of our history. And to imagine its end, we must act now. Dear Reader, at this pivotal moment, what would we ask of you? We know that people within communities targeted by hostile environments continue to support one another, tirelessly. We know that many are using their voices, their power, to make loud and clear that this Bill is a travesty, and to demand an end to the hostile environment. What part will you play? What can you do to support? Day of Solidarity Across West Yorkshire vs “Small Boats” Bill On Saturday 22nd April, Stop the Scan Campaign Group and Yorkshire Resists presented an informative afternoon in Leeds for attendees to discuss and understand The “Small Boats” bill, in collaboration with  our sibling and friend organisations- Free 2 B-Me Bradford are a LGBTQ+ led grassroots organisation based in Bradford who believe in a fair, diverse and equal society. Their community social group is ran and held for queer individuals in Bradford. Their presentation spoke about how the  poses a serious threat to those currently in the process of gaining asylum, as well as those who look to seek it in the future. The bill will make it extremely difficult for any LGBTQ+ person, who’s afraid of being hurt, or possibly even killed in their country of origin, to get long term protection in the UK. Anti Raids Leeds & Anti Raids Bradford are a network of every day people are resisting immigration raids in their homes, workplaces and neighborhoods. Their aim is to solely gather and spread information which could be used to oppose raids. Information includes alerts about raids, practical and legal resources, and stories and examples of resistance. The speakers on behalf of the organisation presented their freedom of information which outlined data from September 2022- March 2023 of the raids that have been carried in various areas in Leeds. The Race & Climate Justice Collective addresses how climate change affects migration as well as minority groups, reverting back to our 13th recommendation. Our friends at These Walls Must Fall and Solidarity Knows No Borders held a protest in Halifax calling on upon Calderdale Council to pass a motion to reject this Bill.

Racial Justice Network,The Hola Massacre: the last straw that toppled colonial Kenya,29-Mar-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/the-hola-massacre-the-last-straw-that-toppled-colonial-kenya/,"It has been over a year since the war in Ukraine began, a year ago the heir of the King of England remarked upon it as the sort of thing which is alien to Europe. Such a comment reminds us that the conduct of Imperial violence is perceived as something that takes place ‘over there’, rather than that which happens at home. The amnesia of colonial violence is persistent because it has been distanced from national memory and erased as a source of conscientiousness which might prevent further meddling in the affairs of other nations. 64 years ago, within living memory, on the 3rd of March, 1959, eighty-eight people suffered violent injustice at the hands of security forces employed by the British colonial administration in what has been memorialised as the Hola massacre which led to decisions which brought the colonial administration of Kenya to a close. Eleven of them were beaten to death and over 60 seriously injured following the recommendations and report of a senior superintendent of prisons, JBT Cowan, who was an individual deemed to be effective at getting oath confessions from the Kenyan native communities. The oath was a pledge that was taken in secret under African spiritual ceremony by the Kikuyu communities, securing to support the resistance against British occupation in Kenya. So effective was this oath that the colonisers decided that confessions had to be followed by processes of de-oathing and the adoption of Christianity by the natives as a means of purifying them and was supported by Louis Leakey, a paleo-anthropologist born in Kenya to missionary parents. The process of extracting confessions or recanting, followed by purification before release back in the community is what they called rehabilitation. During the state of emergency that was declared in 1952, and which lasted until 1960, new laws were passed amongst them restricting movement of Kenyan indigenous communities and making oath taking an offence. During that period, about 80,000 detainees were held without trial.The oath was a ritual ceremony of solidarity conducted by Kenyan natives, particularly the Kikuyu community, in which each vowed to support the endeavours of the anticolonial movement and to resist white colonial settlers and occupation on their ancestral lands that they had been displaced from. Individuals who had taken the oath were considered dangerous by the colonial government, so most were tortured and many others killed. A confession included revealing the liberation movements secrets. Rehabilitation was performed to try to counter the oath and de-radicalise them and then make Christians of them. However, this cleansing process was slow and the conservative government in Westminster were becoming impatient and wanted it accelerated and suggested other means be tried. This is why the tried and tested methods of prisons senior superintendent, JBT Cowan were shared and encouraged for use by others responsible for colonial repressions. Those Kenyan liberation fighters captured and suspected of having taken the oath, according to the new military edict, would have these new methods imposed on them until confession. At this time, there were cash incentives offered to the British military for killing natives. Captain Griffiths went as far as to offer a reward of 5 cents for each dead Mau Mau, with hands cut off for identification, to increase his platoon’s killing score, he himself ended up being court-martialed and then acquitted, for cutting off the ears of two Kenyans and shooting them at close range. Amidst the violence, harms and dehumanisation towards Kenya Land and Freedom fighters at the time and those who were supporting them, included public hangings using mobile gallows. Even though hanging had been outlawed in the UK, it was being used abundantly in Kenya at the time. The hangings were done to punish and deter others: to keep the colonised in check. Professor Lonsdale shared that even though they were done behind a screen, one could see the people climbing to the gallows and hear the body dropping. Between 1953 and 1956, 1000 Kenyans were publicly hanged for alleged Mau Mau offences. After the hangings, their dead bodies were displayed publicly in market places, at crossroads, villages and so forth. Their confessions were recorded and played out on mobile radio, vans with loud speakers that were driven around the villages. All this for intimidating the Kenyan population with the hope that it would cause them to betray their cause of obtaining victory over colonisation. Freedom fighter John Maina Kahihu who was a political prisoner, detainee at Hola and survivor of the massacre indicates the movements’ non-waivering resilience, stating that the deal was they could go home if they confessed. ‘We refused to work because we were not guilty. We were here because we were fighting for our freedom and liberation. We hadn’t come to prison to make money.’ Years after the massacre at Hola, Superintendent TBT Cohen was interviewed by the BBC about his actions in Kenya. In the programme, John Cowan, Senior Superintendent of Prisons in Kenya from 1957 to 1963, calmly explains the rationale behind one of the most brutal episodes in the war against the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA)—the Hola Massacre. “I think that Christianity had been tried and hadn’t succeeded with them. And they needed a sort of moral compulsion … to confess their oaths. In one of my camps there was a small faction of ‘Mau Mau’ detainees who were difficult. There was a procedure implemented there, which was successful. We had to coerce them into confessing. We used a little bit of force on them…. I never saw a man, in all the time I was there, having had force used on him in any worse condition than an amateur boxer getting out of a ring.” It was this skill at downscaling the violence that led to him being invited to share with others on his force’s success. It also led him to writing a report ‘the Cowan plan’ that would be utilised by the British authorities when creating a plan of action on how to deal with the Kenya Land and Freedom fighters who had refused to confess and to try to get them to submit to authority on that fateful day in March of 1959. The Kenyan freedom fighter suspects held at Mwea, Kandongu, Manyani and Hola camps were deemed by the British authorities to be hardened detainees. This was because they refused to confess to oathtaking and refused to perform manual labour, declaring themselves political prisoners, who had already served sentences. John Maina Kahihu narrates how the 88 political prisoners were forced to walk about 500 metres to a nearby farm to work under duress. There were 200 officers. 170 stayed outside the fence with guns. 30 armed with batons – njuguma – came inside. The political prisoners were shown tools and ordered to work by digging trenches. They peacefully refused to cooperate, stating they had served their sentence, and that they were not enslaved captives but people fighting for the liberation of their country.  After this refusal, one white officer then blew his whistle signalling for others to join in beating the 88 prisoners continuously from 8.00am to 11.30am. The prisoners did not retaliate, they simply rolled on the ground, trying to protect themselves. When the officers were done and exhausted, different officials were called in. DC Willoughby Thompson recalls arriving at a place full of bodies on the ground, some dead, some alive but with exhausted and shocked officers who did not know what more to do. Realising the political dynamite that lay on his hands and what might happen as a result of what had taken place, the officials decided to take the dead bodies to Malindi via aeroplane. They reported back to the British government that there had been a water contamination incident and the 11 people had died from drinking contaminated water. However, the massacre eventually became exposed and the cover story was blown. JBT Cowan was asked about the need to use excessive force and the Hola Massacre. His response was, ‘the prisoners were not violent but they were insolent and their demeanour was arrogant. None of them was going to do anything at all’. Cowan’s remarks, looking back on those terrible events, are chilling. ‘I didn’t feel guilty, I don’t think. I don’t think that’s quite the word…. I felt extremely sorry that it had gone wrong, but not actually guilty.’ After this cover-up and distortion, the intolerably violent situation became more exposed by the media and the British MP Barbara Castle , who had been following up on the whole situation became infuriated. This led to the matter being addressed at the British Parliament’s House of Commons Debate on the 27th of July 1959. The Hansard debate took place from 10.30 in the night until 2.38 in the early morning. The massacre had come as a disappointment to the British government, even the racist MP Enoch Powell expressed his distaste for the whole affair. The Members of Parliament debate led to demands for action towards the rehabilitation process being stopped in camps and to the release of political prisoners who were held at the time, being released within weeks. It eventually ended British colonial rule as it was structured at the time.  Kenyatta and other political prisoners were released within a couple of years and Kenya gained its independence within 4 years. Those involved in the authorisation and participation in the Hola massacre and its cover-up, including Mr. Lewis, the commissioner of police, were reprimanded and asked to take early retirement. Mr. Sullivan, who had been caught three times with misconduct, was asked to retire without loss of gratuity. It is clear that the period of colonisation matured into coloniality which are those legacies of colonialism that we live with today. Yet it is worth acknowledging key moments and incidents, including the suffering of those who were colonised, how colonial violences were exerted upon innocent peoples and to document their resistance and fighting for liberation. Remembrance of the Hola massacre highlights the hypocrisy of colonial power which seeks to ‘civilise’ through the force of brutality. Hola massacre was a key moment that turned the wheel of change and brought this hypocrisy to light. It is an ill wind that blows no good, but let it be that remembrance of these past winds of change keep us all vigilant to ensure that positive lessons are learned from histories such as these and keep us moving in the direction of the decolonial good.

Racial Justice Network,Celebrating 7 years of RJN,01-Mar-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/celebrating-7-years-of-rjn/,"Here at The Racial Network we’re taking a look back at our journey and celebrating our 7th anniversary as a charity. As we reflect on the connections and networks we have created along the way during this article, members of our RJN team also join us to express what the charity means to them all individually. Since 2016 2016 was the year in which our charity was registered, becoming one of the few  Northern based anti-racist charity’s to exist, we had to face many responsibilities along the way. With our mission set to challenge the injustices of race, racialism and racism we became determined to question superficial equality and the languages of diversity. With a dynamic team of trustees and skills, the early years of RJN became a time for us to define who we were and what we wanted to achieve. Our decision to be inspired and shaped in Black radical tradition and liberation allowed us to set our foundation to racial justice and addressing colonial legacies. Whilst our values and missions continue to focus on repair, learning and resistance in Black and Brown communities this years anniversary we would like to take the time  to acknowledge our network, our RJN team, fellow organisations, our communities and everyone who continues to support us. A Note From Our Director “In the last 7 years as a charity, we have transitioned and evolved through different forms and stages experiencing highs, lows and hard grafting. There have been many individuals, activities, lessons that have left scars, memories and ancestral wisdom that will continue to shape RJN for future generations. We have had a great impact and done big things regionally, nationally and internationally. Witnessing and being part of this metamorphosis whilst maintaining our DNA, radical nature and core purpose is testament not only to our resilience(thank you  to those who believed in us) but also our vitality to our communities, of centering race and colonial analysis whilst maintaining intersectional and international underpinnings. -Dr Penny Wangari-Jones Our Projects & Team After setting our values and missions, in 2019 we defined our projects and aligned them with our objectives, revisiting strategy and evaluating what worked well for our charity. Throughout the years, the emergence of our Unlearning Racism Collective, Stop the Scan, and most recently The Race and Climate Justice collective as well as the re emergence of The Black and Brown Collective Conversations allowed us to expand our team and communities. Unlearning Racism Collective The URC is our collective centered for white-identifying people living in the North. After the circulation and media attention around police brutality and the Black community in 2020, the collective responded with their solidarity to the subsequent uprisings of Black activists around the world and as a result, URC courses and workshops for white people to work through discomfort around concepts of everyday and structural racism was created with grassroots mentors who have years of knowledge and wisdom including Esther-Stanford Xoesi “RJN is love. There’s a radical acceptance of each other. Rooted in trust and a belief that we are all committed to the journey of racial justice. RJN has a unique ability to bring people along on that journey. RJN places the leadership of Black and Brown folk at the centre, particularly with an international lens and pushes that forward at every opportunity. “ -Grace (URC Coordinator) Stop the Scan Campaign In 2019, the Home Office funded a national roll out of mobile fingerprint scanners linked to immigration databases, which turned the UK police into a border force. As the Windrush scandal shows, this move led to mass detentions and deportations. Since the launch of the campaign, the STS team and wider community have made countless progressive changes in assuring the public’s perception and knowledge of the UK’s legal system and police force is interlinked with colonial racial biases and institutionalised racism. In 2021, the group launched their first report in conjunction with sibling organising group Yorkshire Resists . The report discussed the use of mobile biometrics in West Yorkshire (Oct 18-Mar 19). The campaign group continue to inform the UK on police scanning and have since created 3 more reports. “I recently read a book of poetry called ‘I Was Not Born a Sad Poet ‘ by Lorraine Masiya Mponela – who I met at RJN’s Annual Gather Up event. Without giving too much away (everyone should read the book, it’s excellent), in one poem Lorraine writes that now is the time to walk together, indifference is not an option. To me, working with RJN means resisting indifference (my own and others) and trying to walk alongside. It means navigating the space between action , reflection, listening, and sharing – or working out how to hold them together. It means trusting in others, in other worlds and earning trust.” -Carys (Stop The Scan Campaign Officer) Black & Brown Collective Conversations Ensuring race analysis and safer spaces are created within the charity is something we have encouraged throughout our 7 years. Acknowledging the layers we’ve organised monthly talks, panels, forums to highlight intersections and continue public sensitisation and conscientisation this includes our panel talk in Moss Side, Manchester with African-American law professor and activist Kathleen Cleaver in 2018. The re-emergence of our Black and Brown conversational spaces in 2022 allowed us to collaborate and hold conversations inter- generationally, holding space to create Black joy with Leeds Black Feminist Society in November 22 helped us to continue to  explore the importance of building alliances and intersectional approaches that create strength, sustain our activism, and allows us to work together towards bringing about systemic change is something we continue to strive for as the years go on. “My involvement with RJN began in 2017 as just a volunteer, showing up to support campaigns that the organisation held in different spaces to then applying for a role when the opportunity presented itself in 2021. It’s now been almost 2 years since joining the team and I find fulfillment in my opinions being heard, time being respected and values appreciated as RJN continuously works towards equality for minoritised communities.” -Mbuuaraa (Admin Assistant) The Race & Climate Justice Collective One of our key aims since the launch of the charity has been to emphasise the need for international framing and to ensure that colonial legacies, climate debt, and the various struggles/ solutions already in existence from the Global South were considered. After the launch of your 12 recommendations in November 2019  at The Leeds Climate Change Citizen’s Jury, we found that no international framing was included. We insisted to learn, skill-share, strategise and decolonise and in January 2020 we traveled to Kenya. Not long after our trip, we held the next in our series of Collective Conversations on Race and Climate Justice and with the enthusiasm and dedication shown by participants we officially birthed The 13th Recommendation Framework . Both 2022 and 2023 have seen a rise and popularity in the collective, with many volunteers and participants joining us to discuss and be made aware of  our interconnected struggles with our siblings in the Global South. Members of the collective join on the last Tuesday of the month to explore internationalism and how the current climate emergency effects both people in the South as well as the Global majority. Previous guest speakers including artist and activist Ndungi Githuku who alongside Kenyan based community organiser and moboliser Irene Asuwa spoke to the collective to explore what colonialism and coloniality meant and looked like from an international lens. Knowledge is power. But empowered people means a movement to bring the changes we need. I believe RJN has given me the keys to the understanding of how to dismantle the systems which are perpetuating the harm. I am grateful that RJN allows me to be my full self. -Melany (Project Worker) Pastoral Support Supporting, strategising and moving ideas and challenges to action. This has been in the form of disempowered communities starting new community groups, making links with authorities and connecting to other groups facing similar issues. Other forms include individual aspirations of challenging, highlighting or speaking to injustices. Working closely and supporting local sibling organisations like Free 2B-Me allows us to learn from communities who are from the most minortitised groups. It is essential for us to listen and acknowledge our privileges as a charity and network. “ I am grateful to be part of a Black-led grassroots organisation. Community building and organising is something that is encouraged at The Racial Justice Network, I have learned a lot from the many individuals who make the charity what it is today . I’m constantly reassured and empowered to make the right changes in society. “ -Sarai (Communications) A Special Thank You We would like to say a big thank you to everyone who has joined us along the journey so far, whether you have been part of the wider team, a volunteer, our sibling organisations, attending any of our events, we acknowledge you all and without community there would be no RJN. “ The last two years have seen a steady increase in our resources, focus on the governance and infrastructure of the organisation. There have been changes in the board of trustees as well as the staff team which will become visible in the next few months. We look forward to celebrating many more anniversaries. ” (Dr Penny W-J) Our aims since 2016 have been to  focused on repair, learning, resistance and restoring, despite the many rejections from funding applications and set backs we’ve faced as a Black-led charity, we still remain determined to refine and lay our commitments and concepts in fighting for equality and justice within our communities both locally and internationally. As we get closer to our 10th year  milestone we will continue to stay radical and learn from our ancestors, de-centre whiteness and address coloniality, listen and engage with margainalised communites and build radical alternatives which have been built on radical love. Our movements are not over and we look forward to seeing what the future holds for us all as we fight to change legacies and reach for racial justice. Tuko Pamoja!

Racial Justice Network,Gender Recognition Reform Bill- Explained,26-Jan-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/gender-recognition-reform-bill-explained/,"The UK government made the decision to block the implementation of the Scottish Gender Recognition Reform Bill under section 35 of the Scotland Act. This comes at a first in the history of devolution. The UKs recent restrictions towards the bill includes stopping the gender recognition certificate (GRA 2004) which recognisied and respected trans men and womens gender in over 20 countries including Canada,Australia and various states in America. The recent changes places many individuals in unprecedented and unsafe circumstances. According to a recent Census, trans people make up 0.5% of the population here in the UK. Only 0.2 % of trans men and women are able to benefit from The Gender Recognition Bill. Recorded hate crime against trans individuals in England and Wales increased by 56% since 2020. This also opens up a wider intersectional conversation to be held, with Black and Brown trans women facing some of the highest levels of discrimination amongst the community, this implements and outlines anti-transgender biases and structural racism. Although the percentage of people who identify as transgender in the UK is small, it is still our responsibility to acknowledge the inflictions marginalised individuals face. The recent blockage of the bill creates a threat to those who deserve to be respected. We will provide further updates in regards to the bill in the coming months ahead."
Racial Justice Network,Talking Care with Language: Climate Justice Glossary,17-Jan-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/talking-care-with-language-climate-justice-glossary/,"RJNs Race and Climate Justice Collective is delighted to welcome you all to join us for the first session in the 2023 Race and Climate Justice Learning series About this event We begin with the Race and Climate Justice Glossary and in this first session, Abigail will feature an exercise: A Song To The Earth: Channeling Ubuntu in the 13th Recommendation through letter writing. This will look to support how we engage with the series by exploring the way we use language when in discussion about climate and ecological crises and contexts more generally. We will share ways in which we can practice using language with more care, and attention to the principles of the 13th Recommendation Framework, focusing on Ubuntu and using the Climate Justice glossary. In preparation for this session, we would like you to take a moment to think through the ways in which you use language when talking about climate and ecological crises. Are there any words that you regularly find to be problematic and if so, how? We would like you to bring these words to the session for a shared conversation in exploring both the difficulties and importance of using language carefully, respectfully and meaningfully for all. Abigail is a BBC Assistant Producer with a degree in Psychology. Having previously worked alongside Mental Health advocate and researcher Dr Furaha Asani and former RJN trustee Dr Laura Loyola-Hernandez delivering a decolonising Psychology workshop, her work continues to share the importance of radical self-care. Her platform In My Cerebellum invites you to be a guest to her journal entries including workshops that guide you to become a compassionate observer of your thoughts, look into different perspectives and formulate a story to get a deeper understanding of the self.

Racial Justice Network,What does solidarity mean in this planetary crisis?,12-Jan-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/what-does-solidarity-mean-in-this-planetary-crisis/,"The 13th in particular, emerged as an action or a challenge to, what we call the three tenets of the 13th framework, which is internationalism, acknowledging colonial legacies and active solidarity. And within this is an understanding of how everything is interconnected and interdependent when we see and understand social justice issues. The 13th Highlights the interconnectedness of climate, racial justice and universalized oppressions rooted in colonialism. Therefore the question asked to Irene Asuwa is how the 13th relates to their activism and work as academics and social and racial justice advocates in their own communities in Kenya? Irene Asuwa My name is Irene. As a social scientist, I am very passionate about ecological issues so I co-convened a collective community group in Nairobi. We mobilize and organize communities through reclaiming spaces that have been grabbed or are heavily polluted. We rehabilitate and transform them into spaces that people can use, or adapted where nature can have a chance to heal. These spaces are either riparian lands, community grounds or any other space that we can get, which is also very highly dependent on how the land Kenya oversees this. Land is a really big and emotive issue and also very lethal as well in this part of the country. 
This is to stand in the gap of history that has been erased and is slowly being erased even at the moment in school, in the school curriculum. So we are trying to create spaces where people can access literature that is not out in the public or they cant find at school. So next month we are doing a book club for those resource centers, but also just to create spaces where people can come and create and have discussions and just hang out, because such spaces are really rare. The ones that exist, we call them base which are like along the road or in the market or wherever they are, which is also where young people get profiled, so dangerous. So the resource centers are also to create a safe space where people can access the internet and just do things without being profiled by police. So yeah, thats what I do. And I also support outreach at the Ukombozi library, which is in Nairobi as well. Ukombozi library puts together literature that is not easily accessible, such as Kenyan struggles, African struggles, struggles with people of African descent outside the continent and many other struggles. So we work with communities to access this literature, to screen films and to support Ukombozi forums.  Ukombozi means liberation, support dialogue within the communities. How is colonialism related to work on climate justice in Kenya?Kenya is a settler colony. So what that means is that colonisers who are here, or who are still living, feel entitled to most of what they call land, so they feel entitled to all of it. Some of the best lands in Kenya, as per neo-liberal standards, land which has what they consider the fertile soil, the ones that have high yields, the ones that have the best terrain, they are not even owned by the richest Kenyans yet because after the paper, or what you call flag independence, the core of Kenya struggle for independence has been for land and freedom. So thats just a glare of the ecological crisis for Kenya and for many settler colonies in Africa, which have not been divorced from colonialism. Irene was a guest speaker for The Race and Climate Justices session, alongside human rights activist and educator Githuku Ndung. The ecological crisis youre seeing right now, in many parts of Africa, is largely a colonial legacy. So it is, decades of deforestation in Mount Kirinyaga. It is decades and decades and continuing genocide of removing people from range lands under the guise of conservation. Removing and evicting people from forest and concentrating people in the cities. Those evictions create squatters and local refugees. Even if you are a citizen you are a refugee in your own country because you keep being evicted from one place to another. You settle with another community and that community gets evicted. And that continues. At the moment there are many ethnic communities that do not exist anymore, theyve been cleansed as a result of that. Lumping people together is called kanji.  As a result people have had to join dominant communities as a survival tactic, people lose their identity completely, which is another form of genocide if you ask me.  If you look at our laws as much as we have a new constitution that was inaugurated in 2010, Kenya brags about a very vibrant legal and policy framework at home at UNESCO and all these other high level meetings, our colonial laws are very punitive. It still criminalizes indigenous farmers which are at the mercy of corporations. Small and medium term farmers have to depend on aggravates for seeds for farm inputs or fertilizers which are red listed in the European market. They have poisoned our food and the water sources.  Lamu island,Kenya There is no process to engage and prevent the extraction and violence. A lot of people have lost their homes. What is currently happening in Lamu with the proposed compliance, the lab set and all the mining, basically in all remote areas. There is a possibility of one or more mining corporations taking advantage of the fact that it is a remote area. People dont understand due process so they can come overnight and do whatever they want. There are instances where people sleep in the night they wake up and realize someone was mining below their home! When youre sleeping, you wake up, youre coughing. Your lungs are hurting and you wonder why?, when you go outside you realize there was a corporation that was mining overnight. So the mining and extractives sector has done so much harm and is still doing so much damage. Then there is of course the continued alienation of people from natural resources which was colonial as well. In into Sumo, theres only one access point to the NIC right now. All other access points either have private resorts, or these are ruled out for a port, which random people are not allowed to go to. So its exclusive to a specific class of people. Whenever, lets say an animal or a human being falls into a dam, government rushes very fast to fence it and drive people away under the guise of creating security so that someone doesnt fall in there again, and stuff like that, but its just a tactic to kick people out of that land. In Mombasa people have been harassed on the beach. The last time I was there last year around in November there are places where at 6 pm you need to be out. There are also neighborhoods in Nairobi where I cant go because Ill be asked so many questions. The last time I was in one of them with a friend, we were interrogating someone as if we were suspects of a crime. Yet this is Nairobi. It is a public road. But because we looked like we were not supposed to be there. We were questioned. It was like 30 minutes of question after question after question. What are you doing? Why did you think about coming here? Can you imagine being asked to go to your country? Its so ridiculous. Like what kind of question is that? Its like walking on the streets and then someone asks you, Okay, so why did you decide to walk on the street today?The last thing is the accessibility of green spaces. In Nairobi, I think almost all of them are gone with a very small percentage remaining. So the National Park has a very small percentage remaining. Karura forest also has a very small percentage remaining and city park, it is safe to say that it is gone because they are fencing it. Actually in Karura we are contesting a proposition to have people book an appointment like make a reservation. Like its so ridiculous. If you make a reservation to access I feel like you have to see on Friday, we are coming to Karuna then the management and say no. Please pick another date. These are examples of environmental apartheid thats going on and those are some techniques that I used. What would you suggest, in a space such as this, how we see the legacies of colonization and how we move forward beyond? Have conversations such as these, but as we do them, we do not deliberately erase lived realities. They would say, there is no data, it is not real, to dismiss the lived realities. I have been to embassies in the country, and its apalling to see they are supporting the government. For us Afrikan voices, the climate emergency is not something to predict, it is a lived reality that we have been experiencing for a while. Amplify the work of African organizing, without depoliticising the message or the lived experience. Provide enough time for us to reflect and share our experiences without censoring our voices. Gives us time to explain our conditions and how we got there, around the political and economic environments. We are not making things up. No one would make such sad realities up. The solidarity we look for is different from what NGOs do. Because they put you on a pedestal, and there are things you cant say, or support they can t give. But if people are organizing around many forms of harm and the priorities change and for example I cant use the money to bail people out of jail, then it is not useful. The support given should reflect the lived realities from people, and recognise and appreciate the environment we are operating in and be as flexible as possible. The support recognises the interconnection of the climate crisis with the socio economic crisis because, for example, we cant expect communities that live in the urban areas to quickly embrace conservation when they have never seen a park, and lived in concrete areas, while they worry about when they are going to eat next or when they are going to catch a bullet, is a long shot. For some of the groups I have worked with it has taken over a year. It is not their fault, even the schools they went to are concrete jungles, they are teenagers that for the first time see green spaces."

Racial Justice Network,Protecting LGBTQ+ Rights Internationally,12-Jan-23,https://racialjusticenetwork.co.uk/protecting-lgbtq-rights-internationally/,"The recent news of the passing of Kenyan LGBTQ+ rights activist Edwin Chiloba has raised a bigger issue that is yet to be addressed. An international call out to campaign for the rights and protection of members of the LGBTQ community.  Getty/Atlantic Due to British colonial-era laws, there is still a ban on homosexuality, this law still exists in many parts of the world including Kenya. This leads to damaging legacies on all 69 countries that still criminalise individuals who are part of LGBTQ+ communities. Queer Black and Brown individuals are faced with the most challenges with socio- cultural prejudices towards them not only in the LGBTQ+ communities but in the wider communities are still a massive issue. The public prejudices affects the well being and protection of individuals. In a 2020 report published by The International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) the criminalisation of homosexuality was enforced in 34 UN member states. This leads us to ask the question, who is protecting our queer siblings?  ILGA World Adverse public attitudes, and in turn a lack of safe space for LGBTQ+ individuals, are often fueled by condemnation from religious and political organisations and leaders. Although we are globally witnessing the progressive change of queer representation in the media and other platforms, we still need to acknowledge that cases of hate speech and violence still remain at the forefront for many individuals within LGBTQ + communities across the globe. Ways in which you can support LGBTQ+ individuals : African Queer Youth Initiative are a network of youth activists and organisations who mobilise, support and amplify the voices of LGBTQ+ activists. The organisation helps build the visibility of LGBTQ+ youth in Africa. Queer Hive Kenya A non-profit organisation that advocates for the equal rights of LGBTQ+ people in Kenya, through positive building this includes re establishing working relationships with institutions and civil society organisations. AfroQueer Podcast Telling the stories of Queer Africans from across the continent and diaspora. The podcast celebrates queer love, and explores the laws affecting their lives, migration, media, race, class and much more. Episodes discuss the meanings of being Queer and African and spotlights individuals shifting the landscape of African queerness."

Hastings Community of Sanctuary,Joint Statement on Northeye: 4th September 2023,04-Sep-23,https://hastings.cityofsanctuary.org/2023/09/04/joint-statement-on-northeye-4th-september-2023,"On 31st August 2023 it was announced by Huw Merriman MP that the Northeye site in Bexhill has been confirmed for use as a Detention Centre, rather than the initially proposed Accommodation Centre. We are incredibly disappointed by this decision and shocked to hear both Huw Merriman and other local campaigners describe this as a victory. We have worked in Bexhill for several years and have a great deal of support for people seeking refuge from local people who consider this a humanitarian issue. In championing this decision, Mr Merriman seems to be only representing a small yet loud minority of constituents who are basing their increasingly racist arguments on totally unfounded concerns. We already had serious concerns about the use of Northeye as an Accommodation Centre. Such centres across the country, including Napier Barracks and Manston in our neighbouring Kent County have been an absolute disaster for the people placed there, with reports from residents and national charities and agencies confirming the appalling conditions, including people sleeping on cardboard on floors, lack of access to hygiene facilities, poor quality food, and outbreaks of serious health conditions. More recently, the debacle with the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland has brought to light the Home Office’s lack of due diligence in terms of the legionnaires present in the water system, and its failure to heed safety warning which has now resulted in the Fire Brigades Union taking it to Court. Detention Centres have a similarly terrible record, such as the infamous Yarl’s Wood centre in Bedfordshire which was the subject of several damning reports, and as of the latest report in 2022 is still housing vulnerable people, despite Home Office policy to the contrary. We therefore have no confidence in the government’s ability to manage their facilities in a humane way. Despite the scapegoating of people seeking asylum and the Illegal Migration Act which recently passed, the UK has international responsibilities under The Refugee Convention to hear and consider the claims of people seeking asylum in this country. While doing so it has a duty to treat people with the respect and humanity they deserve. There are also significant questions to be raised over the potential cost of this detention site. The update from Huw Merriman states that to meet the requirements of the new designation as a detention site, the existing buildings will all need to be demolished and new ones built in their place. There is currently a lack of housing across the country, and this is being felt keenly across the whole of East Sussex. We suggest that the millions of pounds this project is going to cost would be far better spent on affordable community housing. We are very clear: our position on the use of the Northeye site to house people seeking refuge has not changed. We are completely against this plan, which will see people seeking refuge detained in terrible conditions with litle to no access to the support and services they require.

Hastings Community of Sanctuary,Why we oppose the plans for Northeye,06-Oct-23,https://hastings.cityofsanctuary.org/2023/10/06/why-we-oppose-the-plans-for-northeye,"On behalf of Hastings Community of Sanctuary and Amnesty International Hastings & Rye, Pal Luthra explains why they oppose the Home Office’s plans for the former prison of Northeye in Bexhill, whether as an asylum centre or Immigration Detention Centre, as well as the stance of the local MP, Huw Merriman (article written for Hastings Online Times , 04/10/23). In March the Home Office Minister, Robert Jenrick, announced that a former prison in Bexhill had been chosen to house asylum seekers. There have been several demonstrations since under the slogan No to Northeye, opposing the proposals, to a large extent on public safety grounds. In response to the protests, Huw Merriman, MP for Bexhill & Battle, stated on his website in April, “My main concern is that local residents feel safe given those at the centre, whilst monitored for comings and goings, are not under a curfew.” Instead of challenging the misconception that asylum seekers pose any threat to the local community, it was Mr Merriman’s main concern for opposing the asylum centre. What was the basis of this assertion? Where was his evidence that asylum seekers posed a threat to the safety of locals? There is no denying that asylum seekers, like any other group, would have some criminals, people with mental health issues and people driven to opportunistic petty crime due to poverty or destitution. According to the Oxford Migration Observatory, quoted in The Guardian , “There is little evidence that migrants are any more or less likely to commit crimes than any other members of the population.” His reasons for opposing it seem to be opportunism and political expediency. It is maybe not surprising that No to Northeye and Mr Merriman’s main concern was safety. The Home Secretary Suella Braverman has also peddled a similar untruth about asylum seekers, that they pose a threat of “heightened levels of criminality” including “drug-dealing, exploitation, prostitution.” She claimed that her evidence was based on her “conversations with many police chiefs around the country.” However, according to the police, also reported in The Guardian , those who arrive in small boats are vulnerable and can be victims or become victims of exploitation…” Mr Merriman gave credence to the prejudicial and racially biased propaganda. In August he claimed that due to his reasoned and constructive dialogue with the Home Office what is now being proposed is a closed site more suitable as a “detention centre and that those staying will not be expected to remain for longer than 45 days.” The history of detention centres, otherwise known as Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs), is not glorious. For example, the report of Her Majesty’s Inspector of Prisons (HMIP) on the Gatwick IRC (Brook House and Tinsley House) in 2022 found that 28% of detained men said they had felt suicidal at the centre and 80% said they had felt depressed. According to the statutory Independent Monitoring Board report, there were incidents of assaults and violence, and detainees reported incidents of bullying, intimidation or assault by staff. The assessment process failed to prevent the detention of a significant number of men with mental health issues. Around 15% of the Brook House population had been in detention for an average of 23 weeks and some for a longer period, according to the Independent Monitoring Board’s annual report . A recent public enquiry report published into Brook House found a toxic culture with detainees forcibly moved while naked and some subjected to unnecessary pain. Detainees were subjected to degrading treatment,  racist and derogatory language and inappropriate and dangerous force by staff.  Brook House is not an isolated example. An HMIP report on the Colnbrook IRC said that a quarter of detainees said they had felt suicidal while in the centre. There had been 41 self-harm incidents in the previous six months, of which two were serious (HMIP Colnbrook report March 2022). The truth is that the proposed detention centre in Bexhill will be a prison and a deportation centre, a place of misery where detainees feel suicidal and want to self-harm, where there is bullying, intimidation and/or assaults by staff and where dreams are crushed.  For Mr Merriman to present the possibility of such a centre in Bexhill as some sort of victory is delusional and shameless populism. Mr Merriman seems to be only representing a small yet loud minority of constituents who are basing their increasingly racist arguments on totally unfounded concerns. The answer to objections to using this site is not to change its designation from a place of social isolation to a place of incarceration. We oppose both proposals for non-detained asylum accommodation and deportation centre on the grounds of human rights, human decency and based on the reality of other asylum centres. Such centres across the country, including Napier Barracks and Manston in neighbouring Kent, have been an absolute disaster for the people placed there, with reports from residents and national charities and agencies confirming the appalling conditions, including people sleeping on cardboard on floors, lack of access to hygiene facilities, poor quality food, and outbreaks of serious conditions of ill-health. More recently, the debacle with the Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland has brought to light the Home Office’s lack of due diligence, both in terms of the legionnaires’ disease present in the water system and its failure to heed safety warnings which has now resulted in the Fire Brigades Union taking it to court. Detention centres have a similarly terrible record, such as the infamous Yarl’s Wood centre in Bedfordshire which has been the subject of several damning reports , and which, as of the latest report relating to 2022 , is still housing vulnerable people, despite the previous recommendations to the contrary by the Independent Monitoring Board. We therefore have no confidence in the government’s ability to manage their facilities humanely. This government does not have a track record of acting humanely when it comes to asylum seekers. If judged to be lawful when it comes before the Supreme Court in November, the draconian Illegal Migration Act gives the Home Secretary unfettered powers to expel virtually everyone who arrives or enters the UK without permission. It would almost entirely shut down the UK’s asylum system by blocking asylum seekers from claiming asylum in the UK. It has effectively outlawed asylum in this country. It is unlikely to reduce the number of crossings but it will certainly increase the need for more detention centres as asylum seekers are classified as ‘illegal migrants’ subject to deportation with no right to appeal. Furthermore, everyone affected would be detained indefinitely until expelled, either to their own country or a “safe third country” if the former is impossible. There is little or no chance other countries will be willing to take deportees from the UK – why should they? Mr Merriman should instead demand that the Home Secretary put her department to work fairly, and efficiently, showing respect for our international legal obligations and human rights, in processing asylum claims. According to the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR , the act is in breach of the UK’s obligations under the Refugee Convention, the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, the 1961 Convention for the Reduction of Statelessness and international human rights law and would significantly undermine the international refugee protection system. He should also demand that she repeal her Illegal Migration Act. Persisting with this unlawful, immoral and expensive policy can do no good for the people of Bexhill or asylum seekers. Simply ramping up the cruelty and cost by establishing Northeye as an immigration detention centre is as reckless as it is nasty and inhumane. There is currently a lack of affordable social housing across the country, and this is being felt keenly across the whole of East Sussex. We suggest that the millions of pounds this project is going to cost would be far better spent on affordable social housing. We are very clear: our position on the use of the Northeye site to house people seeking refuge has not changed. We are completely against this plan, which will see people seeking refuge detained in terrible conditions with little or no access to the support and services they require."
Hastings Community of Sanctuary,East Sussex Library & Information Service gains Sanctuary Award,13-Oct-23,https://hastings.cityofsanctuary.org/2023/10/13/east-sussex-library-information-service-gains-sanctuary-award,"Public libraries are a fantastic resource, and they can play an important role in welcoming refugees and people seeking sanctuary in our communities. To support this, Hastings Community of Sanctuary has been working with the East Sussex Library & Information Service under the Libraries of Sanctuary scheme run by City of Sanctuary UK . Libraries of Sanctuary is a network of librarians, library staff, community groups and book lovers who are raising awareness of the issues facing people in the asylum system, offering support and participation opportunities, and contributing to a culture of welcome in the wider community. The Library of Sanctuary Award recognises and celebrates the libraries that go above and beyond to show solidarity and welcome.  A panel met in July to assess the application from East Sussex Library Service, which included feedback from people with lived experience of the UK asylum system, and were unanimous in their decision to grant the award. The Library Service had showed great enthusiasm in learning about the experience of seeking sanctuary and understanding the issues facing sanctuary seekers. They had also thought carefully about how to make their libraries more welcoming, and how to support sanctuary seekers to make full use of the services on offer, which include books in multiple languages, English conversation sessions and events to celebrate Refugee Week. Kristy Child, Libraries Operations Manager at East Sussex County Council said: “The East Sussex Library and Information Service are proud to have been awarded Library of Sanctuary status.  We will continue to support sanctuary seekers by ensuring we provide welcoming, safe spaces and offering conversation and language courses as well as free internet access and signposting to other supportive services. We would like to thank everyone at Hastings Community of Sanctuary who have offered their support and we look forward to working with them moving forward.” As part of the process, Hastings Library were partners in a project linked to the Sanctuary Festival. Nine Hastings residents with lived experience of the UK asylum system took part in creative workshops led by artists Anne-Marie Watson and Fatima Esayli and English tutor Kathy Briscoe.  Their brief was to design a banner to hang in the entrance hall of the library that communicated a message of welcome to all communities. “[We feel] very proud. Our soul is in the banner – different lives and cultures in Hastings together in one place in a colourful way.” Victoria, project participant The beautiful artwork was installed in July and is the perfect expression of what it means to be a Library of Sanctuary."

From immigration advice, campaigning for change, improving wellbeing to emergency support  keep reading for more info on how LRMN improved support for migrants in our community. Facts and figures 1,671 People supported by LRMN 809 People given immigration advice 100% Of Lewisham GPs are Safe Surgeries Message from our CEO We will always stand by people standing up to an unjust immigration system. This year, we have also ensured that our services respond directly to the needs of our communities. In addition to our longstanding services, including specialist legal advice on immigration, housing, welfare and support for women survivors of gender-based abuse, we were able to secure funding for new services, as well as continue our campaigning work. More and more people coming through our doors at LRMN are asylum seekers staying in unsuitable accommodation, meaning that weve been offering outreach support alongside other partners. In the coming year, we will continue to work for our communities, and campaign for sanctuary for all. LRMN truly provides a safe haven for people simply trying to rebuild their lives, and that is down to our wonderful team, the trustees, the volunteers, and our clients, who make LRMN creative, dynamic, joyful, and effective in making real, tangible change. A real difference  Miris story When Tatsu found Miri sleeping in the corridor of her building, she couldnt imagine what Miri had been through. After hearing her story, Tatsu brought Miri straight to LRMN, where we started our work to support her. Miris in-laws had been threatening her, and she had been experiencing domestic abuse. One day, Miri couldnt take it anymore and left for the UK with her children. She had saved all her money to pay the agency for the documents, travel, and accommodation, transferring her life savings. However, Miris host took her money and passport to lock them away. Then she made Miri work in the house, unpaid. Miris children were not allowed to leave their bedroom. It was violent, difficult, and exhausting  and one day, she had packed her bags and ran. LRMN immediately secured emergency support and accommodation for Miri and her family, and secured immigration advice from a specialist agency working on modern slavery. As a result, Miri is now on the path to being safely able to stay in the UK, getting the support she needs, and her children are finally able to attend school. Overcoming isolation  Delilahs story When Delilah came to LRMN, she was struggling with low confidence. Having experienced gender-based abuse, she was determined to rebuild her life in the UK.Despite her professional background, she often felt isolated in the UK and was anxious about her standard of English. After joining our womens activities, she was introduced to Building People, Changing Minds. She signed up to become a volunteer and took part in Employment and Sanctuary training run by LRMN. During her placements, her confidence blossomed. She was able to practise her English and bring out the professional skills she had cultivated over the years. With this newfound confidence, she was able to encourage a local institution to commit to becoming a place of sanctuary. Now, she plans to take on more volunteering in the Borough in order to continue developing her connections across Lewisham, improving her mental health through social connection. Many of those who walk through the doors of LRMN feel alone. We work to break down those barriers, supporting people to build their communities back up. Click here to read the full Impact Report.

Lewisham Refugee Migrant Network,World Book Day 2023,02-Mar-23,https://www.lrmn.org.uk/world-book-day-2023/,"Books can be a great way of sharing stories and ideas. For many people from sanctuary-seeking backgrounds, writing can provide a space to share insights into their lives and experiences. Some members of the LRMN team have put together a list of fiction and non-fiction recommended reads Take Away (Stories From a Childhood Behind the Counter) by Angela Hui This is wonderfully human story through the eyes of a 12-year-old member of a newly arrived Hong Kong family working hard to make a living in the UK. The book gives insights not only into the family and how the child sees the world but also into life in the Welsh mining village where the family settle. It tells you more than a bookcase full of textbooks could hope to do.  Mark, LRMN Immigration Manager Signs Preceding the End of the World by Yuri Herrera Signs Preceding the End of the World is an immersive delve into the experience of migration from the point of Makina, a young Mexican woman who is sent north across the Rio Grande to track down her brother, who has not been heard of for a worryingly long period of time. To make the trip she needs the support of various gangsters who either owe or are owed favours. As she moves forward something becomes clear to her: to be prepared for this world it seems all the memories and understandings of the things that made you what you thought you were have to be allowed to fade. Only then will you get the papers that seem to be so important if you are to survive. The thing is, the more these papers fit you to live in this new world, the less and less will they be about you. An utterly riveting tale.  Don, LRMN Migrant Hub Volunteer On Earth Were Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong Written as a letter to his mother, the book follows the authors life growing up in America after emigrating from his native Vietnam with his mother and grandmother. The story covers subjects including intergenerational trauma, family bonds and coming out as gay. The writing has a poetic style that is simple yet impactful, drawing the reader into the emotional world of the author. I recommend this book because it really captures the feelings and complications of migration and integrating into a new society. It has helped me better understand some elements of my familys own migration journey from the Caribbean to North America and UK.  Salena, LRMN Comms Volunteer Deporting Black Britons: Portraits of Deportation to Jamaica by Luke de Noronha This book traces the life stories of four black men who have been deported from the UK to Jamaica, separating them from their families, loved ones and community. It offers an insight into the devastating impacts of deportation, as well as the harms caused by state racism and the wider British border regime. A definite recommended read.  Hope, LRMN Campaigns and Communications Officer The Other Side of Hope (2nd edition) This is an amazing collection of short stories, non-fiction and poems written and edited by refugees and immigrants. It takes you into their inner world. A must read!  Sabrina, Greenwich Borough of Sanctuary Volunteer"

Lewisham Refugee Migrant Network,Lewisham residents demand urgent action on poor housing conditions,13-Dec-22,https://www.lrmn.org.uk/1503-2/,"Over 25 people gathered outside the Town Hall yesterday to call for an urgent change in housing conditions in Lewisham. Members of Lewisham Citizens, a civil society alliance of 18 local institutions, met at Laurence House on Thursday afternoon to deliver Christmas cards to the Cabinet Member for Housing, Councillor Sophie Davis. Each Christmas card contained images of poor housing conditions in the Borough and a message demanding reform. In the wake of the shocking death of Awaab Ishak in Rochdale, Lewisham Citizens are determined to work with the Council to make sure such a tragedy does not occur in Lewisham. No one should have to endure freezing temperatures because their window has fallen out and no one has bothered to replace it, no one should escape a war only to find themselves battling for a safe home. And yet, we know dozens of people facing exactly these issues. Said a speaker from Lewisham Refugee and Migrant Network. They continued: Lewisham is a Borough of Sanctuary, and we are proud that the Council has taken steps to build a place of safety and welcome, but too many people do not get a chance to experience what a true sanctuary is. Messages on the cards read For Christmas, Wed love a safe place to live! and All I want for Christmas is for my walls to not be crumbling. Children from St Marys School also hand wrote cards delivered to Councillor Sophie Davis. A mother from a local school shared her story, highlighting how her child must now use an asthma inhaler due to the mould in her home. Responding to the cards, the Councillor emphasised these conditions were not acceptable and that the Council were working on solutions. She also expressed that she would keep working alongside the Lewisham Citizens team. This campaign is the result of a listening exercise, in which hundreds of people spoke of persistent issues with damp and mould. Many highlighted Lewisham Homes unanswered maintenance requests and overcrowding, and inadequate responses from the provider. All I want for Christmas is for my walls to not be crumbling. In April 2022, ahead of his re-election, Mayor Damien Egan made public commitments to Lewisham Citizens to implement a number of policy solutions designed by local people. The changes include a new approach to auditing housing conditions, clarifying escalation processes, and cultural competence training for council staff. This action asked for urgent movement on these commitments. Seeking similar changes, last week, Labour MP for Lewisham East, Janet Daby, wrote a letter to all social housing providers in Lewisham calling for them to combat damp and mould in the housing they provide. As a recognised Council of Sanctuary, Lewisham has publicly committed to creating a safe and welcoming environment for all sanctuary seekers within the borough.Scottish Refugee Council"
Scottish Refugee Council,Rwanda Bill: We urge MPs to reject legislation,12-Dec-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/rwanda-bill-house-commons-sunak-refugees/,"The Rwanda Bill has now passed its third reading in the House of Commons. The legislation will go to the House of Lords towards the end of January. We support a joint briefing from Freedom from Torture and The Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA), which urges the House to continue to oppose the Bill at each stage. The highest court in the land has ruled that Rwanda is not a safe place to send people seeking protection. Rather than investing money and resources in a fair and efficient asylum system, the Government is continuing to pursue this cruel, unworkable and unlawful policy. The Rwanda Bill: Breaches the European Convention on Human Rights Reverses the Supreme Court’s assessment of the risk of harm in Rwanda, without addressing concerns about the Rwandan asylum system. Disapplies treaties that the UK is bound by internationally – setting a poor precedent and making the UK an unreliable international partner. Threatens the UK’s role as a global leader in championing the rule of law, democracy and human rights. This Bill, which reinforces the worst elements of the Illegal Migration Act, would place the United Kingdom at risk of breaching international obligations laid out in: The European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’) The 1951 Refugee Convention, and its 1967 Protocol The 1984 UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (‘UNCAT’) The 1966 UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (‘ICCPR’) The 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child It also places the UK’s obligations under the European Convention on Action against Trafficking at risk, given that victims of modern slavery and trafficking are among those threatened with removal to Rwanda. The UK’s Supreme Court unanimously decided that individuals sent to Rwanda would face a real risk of ill-treatment. No legislative sleight of hand can change this. Safety in Rwanda If Rwanda was truly safe, the Bill would not need to exclude Rwandan nationals from its scope, The Bill and the Treaty do not address issues raised by the Supreme Court, including: A need to promote understanding of obligations under the Refugee Convention, which have not developed in the years that Rwanda has hosted refugees. For example, between 2020 and 2022, UNHCR found that Afghan, Syrian and Yemeni asylum claims had a 100% rejection rate in Rwanda. A need to improve Rwanda’s poor human rights record, or the profound concerns which remain. The most serious incident occurred in 2018, when Rwandan police fired live ammunition at refugees protesting over cuts to food rations, killing at least 12 people. What we’d like to see The Rwanda Bill  scrapped in its entirety. The government focus instead on long-term solutions and invest in a fair and efficient asylum system that works for everyone. Find out more about our campaign for a better plan. People seeking protection being treated with compassion and dignity. Polling A poll run by Together with Refugees showed that 80% of people in the UK want an asylum system that is well managed, fair and compassionate. Only 18% of the British public think the government’s approach to the asylum system is working well We are raising money for refugees in urgent need. Find out more about our winter appeal.

Scottish Refugee Council,Fair Begins Here: it’s time to make the asylum system work for everyone,11-Dec-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/fair-begins-here-refugee-campaign/,"We’ve join hundreds of charities, faith groups and famous faces to launch Fair Begins Here, a new campaign calling for a better plan for refugees. Too many people are stuck in limbo – separated from their families and barred from finding work while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. Too many are living in short term accommodation, hotel rooms and army barracks. And as we write, the UK government is still trying to banish people fleeing persecution to Rwanda, despite the highest court in the land ruling the scheme unlawful. These policies aren’t working for refugees and they aren’t working for local communities. That’s why we’ve come together to say we’ve had enough. Enough of the division; enough of the short-term thinking; enough of making people pay the price for wrong-headed political decisions. We know we’re not the only ones to feel this way. Actors Brian Cox and Sophie Okonedo, footballer Gary Lineker, and tv chef Big Zuu are just some of the influential figures getting behind the new campaign from Together With Refugees by adding their names to an open letter telling party leaders that enough is enough. A better plan is needed Given the chance, we know communities across the country are happy to go the extra mile to welcome refugees by opening their homes, volunteering, donating and speaking out.  And, given the chance, refugees do so much to enrich our society as they build new lives in Scotland. We’re calling on the political leaders of all parties to commit to a new plan for refugees – one that: Ensures protection for people fleeing war and persecution by upholding the UK’s commitment under international law to the right to claim asylum and by scrapping the Rwanda scheme. Provides a proper strategy for welcoming and integrating refugees by ensuring fair, rapid decisions on their application for asylum, and the chance to rebuild their lives through settling in a community, being allowed to work and the chance to learn English. Forges stronger global cooperation to tackle the root causes that force people to flee their homes and provides positive solutions when they do, including through safe routes to refugee protection. We invite you to join our call for a new and better plan for refugees. One that is fair, humane and gets the system working again, for everyone. Because fair begins here.

Scottish Refugee Council,Refugee Councils chosen for Guardian Charity Appeal,08-Dec-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/refugee-councils-chosen-for-guardian-charity-appeal/,"We are delighted to reveal that, along with the Refugee Council and the Welsh Refugee Council, we are one of the Guardian’s featured organisations for their annual Charity Appeal . The appeal, which launches today, encourages readers to donate to the chosen charities in order to help refugees rebuild their lives in the UK. As part of the appeal, the Guardian and the Observer will highlight the charities’ vital work and share the stories of some of the people they’ve helped. Our CEO Sabir Zazai said: “We are delighted to have been chosen as one of the Guardian’s featured charities this winter. “Our services are needed now more than ever. Our team have been working non-stop to support people seeking safety in Scotland, but there is always so much more to do. The Guardian readers’ donations will go towards making sure people are welcomed, supported and listened to. “We hope this campaign sends a message of solidarity to everyone who has been forced to flee their home. We all deserve a warm welcome and a safe home this Christmas.” Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “ The solidarity of the public is all the more important this year given the Government’s hostile policies that are having such a devastating impact on all those we work with. “With the support of the Guardian and Observer’s readers, the Refugee Councils of Britain will keep working to build a fair and humane asylum system that upholds our international commitments to provide protection to those who need it.” The appeal will help to fund vital services across the country which support refugees to connect with their local community and return to employment.  It will also help fund the Councils’ campaigning work – championing refugee rights and raising awareness by promoting the voices and experiences of refugee communities across the UK. The other charities chosen by the Guardian are hosting charity Refugees at Home and NACCOM, the national network of frontline organisations working to end destitution amongst people seeking asylum, refugees and migrants.

Scottish Refugee Council,Housing emergency must end,01-Dec-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/housing-emergency-must-end/,"People in Scotland continue to face a chronic shortage of suitable housing, with Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils admitting that we are now in the grip of a housing emergency. Our advice teams are working flat-out to make sure no one is left out in the cold. But often the only accommodation available is temporary and very short term. We are desperate to find people safe, appropriate and long-term housing which provides a sense of security and a solid foundation for the future. Too many people are surviving night-to-night, week-to-week, relying on informal support networks and the goodness of community groups, mosques and churches. We are calling on the Scottish Government to immediately prioritise this crisis by allocating the necessary emergency funds in the upcoming Scottish budget to be announced on 19 December and doing whatever it takes to resolve the housing emergency, for everyone in Scotland, for the long term.

Scottish Refugee Council,Help refugees in need this winter,30-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/winter-appeal-help-refugees/,"We’ve launched a Winter Appeal to support refugees in urgent need. As temperatures drop, more and more people who have fled war, torture and persecution are facing homelessness this winter. Your donations could help change lives. Please give what you can to help people who are struggling to survive. The Home Office is hurriedly trying to clear the ‘backlog’ of asylum cases. These changes mean that people who have been granted refugee status are being given as little as seven days to leave their accommodation and find somewhere new to live. It is an impossible situation which has been made worse by the current housing crisis. People in the asylum system are not allowed to work while their claim is processed. As a result, most new refugees aren’t able to save money for a deposit or rent, leaving them with nowhere to go. In Glasgow alone, up to 1,400 refugees – including families with young children – are at risk of homelessness this winter. We are asking generous Scots to show their support for people who have come here seeking safety by making a donation and adding a message of hope to our virtual Christmas tree. Change someone’s life this winter £5 could buy someone a meal and ensure they eat that day £10 could cover the cost of destitution support for someone facing homelessness £25 could provide a new refugee with advice to help them rebuild their lives £35 could pay for an interpreter to help someone who is still learning English £60 could provide emergency housing for a vulnerable refugee woman Gifts worth giving Looking for the perfect present for your loved ones? Our new shop , has a range of gift cards, tote bags and t-shirts. We love the limited edition t-shirts featuring Dougie the Scottie dog. They were designed for us by artists Dawn Richardson and Yamamah Naram. Our CEO, Sabir Zazai said: “There are thousands of people right across Scotland looking for safety and protection in our communities. “Because of the UK Government’s regressive and inhumane asylum policies, these people have found themselves in really difficult situations. Some are ending up in institutional forms of accommodation or ex-hotels and asked to survive on only £1.30 a day in this cost of living crisis. “By donating to our Winter Appeal, you can send a powerful message to the UK government and show that Scotland is a welcoming place for people seeking protection.” Support our Winter Appeal today.

Scottish Refugee Council,Rise: Refugee Festival Scotland 2024,28-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/rise-refugee-festival-scotland-2024/,"Refugee Festival Scotland 2024 will run from 14-23 June – and the theme is RISE. Every day, we see people – who have been forced to abandon their homes and flee to safety – rise above the challenges and uncertainty and rebuild their lives in Scotland. Their courage, strength and resilience is our inspiration. Refugee Festival Scotland honours those who have made Scotland their home. It celebrates the wealth of art, culture, stories and traditions that New Scots bring to our communities. And it promotes a vision for society where everyone can blossom and has an equal opportunity to flourish. Our unique and uplifting festival brings people together for a celebration like no other. Over ten days, a packed programme of events, exhibitions and live performances will showcase the food, drink, music, poetry, art, language and ideas that people bring with them when they settled in Scotland. We want to shine a spotlight on the communities that welcome new neighbours and the caring, creative and inclusive community spaces that help people seeking safety feel at home. The last few years have been tough. But together, we can rise above the hostile environment and build a better future with refugees in Scotland. We can be there for one another in difficult times. Lift each other up when we fall. Find strength and unity in diversity. Together, we can build more joyful, inclusive communities where everyone belongs, feels supported and has a voice. We look forward to discovering the many ways that artists, activists and communities across Scotland respond to our new theme. You are all invited to join us next June, when we rise together in celebration, solidarity, friendship and welcome.

Scottish Refugee Council,Empowering Practitioners: Meet Our New Training Officer,23-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/empowering-practitioners-meet-our-new-training-officer/,"Meet Susi, our new Training and Development Officer! She will be delivering our training programme on refugee and asylum rights. Tell us a bit about yourself “Previously, I worked with the Prince’s Trust in a similar role, delivering training and casework to young people. The focus was to support young people starting their businesses.  I’ve worked with Scottish Detainee Visitors and other charities in the past. When I saw this role with Scottish Refugee Council, I was genuinely excited.” What attracted you to work for Scottish Refugee Council? “I was attracted to Scottish Refugee Council because of the work that it does in supporting people through a very tough time in their lives. It supports people throughout their journey whether it’s their first day in the UK or whether they have just received their refugee status. There’s support at every stage. Working somewhere I care about is really important to me. And I like that the organisation has got an emphasis on learning both internally and externally, I think it makes a stronger team.” What do you hope to achieve in your role? “In the short term, I want to start delivering the training and get into the role properly. I’ll be continuing to develop the training courses and ensuring we’re keeping up with changes in legislation. Fundamentally, my goal is to empower practitioners and organisations to better understand and support refugees and people seeking asylum in Scotland.” What do you like to do outside of work? “I’m an outdoorsy person, and Edinburgh is a great city for that. There are plenty of parks and green spaces. I’m also in the Edinburgh Brass Band, which is a lot of fun, even though it can be pretty loud. It’s especially fun during the Christmas season when we get to play festive tunes. We practice every week and have two concerts a year. We also take part in a marching band competition, which is quite challenging. It’s surprisingly difficult to march in sync, avoid bumping into people, and play the right notes at the same time. Aside from that, I enjoy life drawing. But most nights, you’ll probably find me watching Netflix or cooking dinner.” If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would it be and why? Oh, there are so many places I want to go. Either Japan or Australia. They’re the ones I’d really like to visit. I think Japan looks beautiful and I’d love to try the food. I think Australia would just be really good fun and a bit of an adventure and lots of sunshine. Find out more about our training courses. Author: Laura Delaney"
Scottish Refugee Council,Join us to celebrate Aref Ghorbani’s new EP No More Shadows,17-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/drygate-glasgow-whats-on-november-aref-ghorbani/,"Join us for a live performance and Q+A to celebrate the debut EP  دیگر سایه ای در کار نیست  (No More Shadows) from Iranian singer and musician, Aref Ghorbani. The work was commissioned by Cross Borders , our programme of arts and cultural activism projects. No More Shadows will be released on BandCamp and YouTube on the 21st November. Aref will celebrate the EP launch with a live performance followed by a Q&A on the 29th of November at Drygate, Glasgow. Aref will perform with some of his closest collaborators, bringing together cultures, stories and music in a celebration of the human spirit. The album encapsulates not only his personal journey but also the collective journey of countless refugees who, like him, have found solace and strength in their pursuit of artistic expression. One special track, Jome Bazaar (Friday Market), sung in his mother tongue, Gilaki, acts as a vessel for the rich cultural heritage of his province and a testament to the resilience of his people. Jome Bazaar holds significant cultural and historical significance. The song gained prominence during a tumultuous period in 1953, but was originally performed by the renowned Gilani singer Ahmad Ashoorpur, a prominent figure in both cultural and political activism. Additionally, the roots of this melody trace back to Polish origins. Following the Second World War, the port city of Pahlevi (now Anzali), located near Aref’s place of birth, served as a primary landing point for Polish refugees escaping the Soviet Union. Adding another layer to this cultural fusion, Aref collaborated with the Scottish Gaelic singer, Mischa Macpherson , to create an updated remix with an unique and harmonious blend of Gilaki and Scottish Gaelic. For Aref, the collaboration with Mischa and the diverse cultural influences embedded in this song symbolize the rich tapestry that refugees bring to their new homes. Aref said: “As someone currently residing in Scotland, I see “Jome Bazaar” as a celebration of diversity, echoing the stories of refugees past and present. This song serves as a testament to how music has the power to connect us, fostering unity while honouring and sharing the unique histories of those who have sought refuge in new lands… As an Iranian refugee musician, I have endured the stifling grip of censorship, restricting the expression of my art. Now, in Scotland, supported by the Scottish Refugee Council, I stand on the precipice of a new chapter—one where the shackles of fear are finally broken.” When: 7 – 9 PM, Wednesday 29 November Where: Drygate, Glasgow. Book tickets here . Tickets are available to book on a sliding scale of £5 – £15. All £15 ticket holders will receive a free download of the EP and all proceeds go towards the performing artists. We will be providing free tickets to people in the asylum process directly. Please get in touch with us for more details. Author: Gilly Furmage"
Scottish Refugee Council,Rwanda ruling: Supreme Court rules against UK government,15-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/rwanda-supreme-court-uk-government-suella-braverman/,"We welcome the news that the Supreme Court has declared the removal of people to Rwanda to be unlawful. The plan was part of a wider, deeply troubling hostile environment towards people who have come to the UK seeking sanctuary. People have been living with the threat of removal to Rwanda hanging over them for the last year, and have told us how this fear has affected them and their loved ones. We hope, rather than scrambling to find a Plan B, the UK government immediately starts to repair the damage done to our asylum system and drops any efforts to force this or a similar scheme through. The evidence submitted by UNHCR on Rwanda’s human rights record was shocking and included more than 100 examples of refoulement, breaching international law, and a 100% rejection rate for asylum applications from people from Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan. Our chief executive, Sabir Zazai, said: “We’re relieved at this potentially life-saving decision from the Supreme Court. Given the evidence of Rwanda’s failure to comply with human rights obligations, it is shocking to think a UK government ever proposed this plan. People have had this threat hanging over them for a whole year. We’ve seen an increase in anxiety and distress that can be traced back directly to this. It’s also been a huge waste of government time and resources that should have been invested in making the current system fairer and more effective.” Read our shared statement on the ruling with refugee groups across the UK. We will continue to campaign against cruel and immoral policies and for the rights of people who come to the UK in search of safety.

Scottish Refugee Council,Hopes increase for free bus travel for people seeking asylum,02-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/hopes-increase-for-free-bus-travel-for-people-seeking-asylum/,"The campaign for free bus travel in Scotland for people seeking asylum is a s tep closer to becoming reality . Maryhill Integration Network and the Voices Network have led the powerful campaign for the change, which would make a huge difference to lives of people experiencing the asylum system. People seeking asylum who are in institutional accommodation have only £1.30 a day to live on. A day pass for a Glasgow bus is now £5. Allowing people to travel for free means they would no longer have to make impossible decisions between buying food for themselves and their families, and travelling to health or legal appointments. The change could benefit 5,000 people currently living in Scotland, and help them to become part of their communities as it will make ESOL classes, volunteer opportunities and social events more accessible. Pinar Aksu, human rights and advocacy co-ordinator at Maryhill Integration Network, said: “We know that currently the immigration system in its form is extremely difficult, however in Scotland we are creating pathways to show we can make positive changes. Having free bus travel will allow people to freely travel, meet friends, attend groups, appointments and more. It will create some form of freedom in a system where movement is restricted. This campaign was led and achieved collectively, a huge well done to everyone at MIN Voices group, the Voices Network and especially to MSP Paul Sweeney, and to all partners.” Rania Mohamed, an adviser at Scottish Refugee Council, said: “Providing free bus travel for destitute asylum seekers, who are not permitted to work and have no recourse to public funds, offers hope in several ways. The freedom to travel without worrying about the cost helps alleviate isolation. It enables easier access to essential services, such as shopping in places that might be cheaper but farther away, attending medical and legal appointments, and exploring volunteering and other opportunities. Additionally, it fosters a sense of community inclusion and contributes to overall well-being.” The Scottish Government has set aside £2 million from the 2024-5 budget to make this happen next year. We are seeking more information and clarity about how and when the government will implement the change. Find out more about our work supporting people seeking protection. Author: Gilly Furmage"
Scottish Refugee Council,Hotels are no place for children to live – calls to stop housing families and children in hotel rooms,02-Nov-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/children-scotland-asylum-hotels-human-rights/,"The Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland has called for an end to the use of hotels for children and families in the asylum system, stating that housing children in hotels ‘violates their human rights’. The commission has released a new report that highlights how this type of accommodation exacerbates existing traumas and can have a detrimental impact on people’s mental health. The report calls for more support for local authorities, asylum accommodation providers, and frontline workers to reduce and mitigate the harm caused to children by these potentially hostile environments. Nicola Killean, Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland, said: “Our starting point is always that no child should have to live in a hotel, or hotel-type accommodation – they are totally unsuitable and violate a wide range of children’s rights.” Esther Muchena, Asylum Services Manager at Scottish Refugee Council, said: “ We know the impact on children living in temporary accommodation can be severe. Children who have already been forced to leave everything they know face even more upheaval, being forced to stay in hotels for long periods of time. Sometimes people are transferred from accommodation to accommodation and children are faced with the added stress of changing schools; socially isolating them from their peers. Many of these types of accommodation have no area for children to play, do homework, eat or meet each other, and where food is provided it often isn’t suitable. ” We are also concerned that the closure of hotels housing families could lead to yet more disruption and children being to moved to further temporary accommodation. We urge the government to ensure appropriate, community-based housing is provided for children and families seeking sanctuary. Facts and figures 90% The number of families surveyed by Refugee Action who reported being placed in a hotel that was unsuitable for children 43 days The average time spent by a family with children in hostel accommodation between 1 April and 30 September 2022 14 days The average time spent by a family with children in B&B accommodation between 1 April and 30 September 2022 Report testimony “Sometimes I feel like I am in prison. I do not know anywhere around me, sometimes I take a walk to ease the tension as there are no other young person in the hotel, I can talk to.” A child living in hotel accommodation “It is not child friendly – there were no activities for children no one spoke to me about what my needs are, we were stuck in one place and was unable to play it was horrible. I hope my family and I never go through this again”. A child living in hotel accommodation “It’s not a good place for children to be.

The report contains contributions from people who have experienced the asylum system first-hand, and includes insights from a number of Scottish refugee and human rights organisations  including ourselves, Maryhill Integration Network, Refuweegee, Refugees For Justice and Just Right Scotland. The report identifies areas of major concern such as unsuitable accommodation, access to information and transport affordability. The recommendations include introducing free bus travel for people seeking asylum, a focus on better accommodation solutions and investing in education and information for people seeking asylum on their rights. The conclusion also states the need for the Scottish Parliament to use its devolved powers to mitigate the impact of the Illegal Migration Act.

Scottish Refugee Council,A helping hand for families,26-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/a-helping-hand-for-families/,"The asylum process is tough for anyone, but it can be especially challenging for families. We give children and parents a helping hand on their asylum journey. Last year, we helped 72 newly arrived families – including 144 children – to understand the complex asylum system and begin rebuilding their lives in Scotland. Our Case Managers are their to support families at every step on their  journey, helping them to access healthcare and education, find legal and financial support and make connections in their new communities. Aisha’s story Aisha (not her real name) and her family fled their home country to escape persecution. She arrived in Glasgow to claim asylum with her husband and their seven-year-old child. Exhausted, traumatised and unable to make sense of the complex asylum system, Aisha called our national helpline for advice. We assigned the family a case manager to reassure and support them on their asylum journey. Aisha’s husband is a survivor of torture and the whole family were anxious and traumatised by their experiences. We referred them to mental health services and put Shirin’s husband in touch with Freedom From Torture where he is getting specialist support. The family have relatives in Glasgow and are keen to stay in the city. The Home Office moved them to an asylum hotel. Aisha and her partner struggled with the cramped living conditions and lack of space for their child to play. People in hotel accommodation are entitled to £9.58 a week to pay for essentials like clothes, shoes, medicine and public transport. But due to Home Office delays, Aisha and her family still haven’t received a single payment. The family were also struggling to eat the meals provided by a Home Office contractor at their hotel. But with no cooking facilities, and no money, Aisha couldn’t prepare her own food. She lost a lot of weight. We helped Aisha and her family apply for an emergency grant to keep them going until their Home Office payments arrive. We also put them in touch with a social worker to help them get the right support and pushed for them to be moved to more suitable accommodation. After four and a half months in the hotel, Aisha and her family were offered accommodation within a local community. We have put them in touch with a nearby foodbank and are helping them settle into their new area. With our help, Aisha has enrolled her child at school and applied for free school meals and a grant to pay for school clothes. We also helped the family apply for a grant so they could buy a laptop and access vital online services and support. We’re helping Aisha and her family prepare for Home Office interviews, making sure they understand what is happening at each step in the process and feel supported along the way. Working closely with JustRight Scotland and Latta & Co solicitors, we aim to help families like Aisha’s get refugee protection in Scotland and feel safe and secure in their new communities.

Scottish Refugee Council,Supporting people in crisis,26-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/supporting-people-in-crisis/,"The asylum system is tough and people seeking refugee protection sometimes fall through the cracks. We offer practical advice and support to people in crisis. Helping people experiencing destitution Last year, we helped more than 350 people who were experiencing destitution, homelessness and extreme poverty. We are there to listen, help people access medical and mental health services, get legal advice and find food, clothing and homelessness support. Bernard’s story Bernard (not his real name) has been in the UK asylum system for over 16 years. He is 64 years old. In 2018 the Home Office rejected Bernard’s request for refugee protection. But he can’t be returned to his home country, the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, because it isn’t safe. Like so many people seeking sanctuary, Bernard is stuck in limbo. The UK government don’t want to provide him with accommodation or financial support. But they won’t let him work and earn money to support himself either. As a result, he is homeless and destitute. Bernard arrived in Glasgow with no money, nowhere to live, no friends or family, and an no idea where to turn for support. He was sleeping on the streets when he reached out to us for help. Bernard suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, which causes swelling in his legs making it difficult for him to walk. We immediately referred him to a homeless GP service where he could get the medical care he so desperately needed. We also helped Bernard find legal support in Scotland and worked with his lawyer to track down information about his case.  Unfortunately, lengthy Home Office delays are preventing Bernard’s new solicitor from getting vital information needed to work on his case, leaving him at risk of long-term homelessness. With our help, Bernard applied for an emergency grant so he can pay for essentials like food and medicine. We also got him a bus pass so he can use public transport and put him in touch with charities providing hot food, warm clothes and laundry facilities. Bernard had no way of accessing vital online services. We gave him a phone and SIM so he can use the internet, contact his GP and stay in touch with his lawyer. Life is often lonely for people like Bernard, who have insecure immigration status. To help tackle the feelings of boredom and isolation, he has signed up for our Volunteering Information Afternoons to meet with organisations looking for volunteers. Due to his age and complex health problems, we were very worried about Bernard sleeping on the streets. Working alongside his lawyer, we successfully applied for him to be given emergency temporary Home Office accommodation and financial support to cover the cost of basic essentials. We also helped Bernard apply for charity accommodation. He is currently on the waiting list and we hope he will soon have somewhere safe and warm to call home. Changes to Home Office policy are leaving hundreds of people out in the cold this winter. We have seen a worrying increase in the number contacting us for help because they have become homeless. Read our Q&A to find out why this is happening, what changes we’re calling for and what to do if you’re worried. Author: Rachel Lamb Our impact"
Scottish Refugee Council,Our statement on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,24-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/gaza-humanitarian-crisis-scottish-refugee-council/,"We are horrified by the desperate humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the targeting of innocent civilians and deaths in Israel, Gaza and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. As a refugee charity, Scottish Refugee Council will always stand in solidarity with people, no matter their nationality, who have no other choice but to leave their homes in search of safety. According to the United Nations, 70 per cent of the total Gaza population of 1.4 million are refugees registered with the UN. The conflict is leading to further mass internal displacement. We echo Amnesty International’s calls to the UK Government to use all diplomatic efforts to uphold civilian protection, ensure justice and accountability and resolve the root causes of the conflict. Charities such as Doctors without Borders have urgently called for sufficient humanitarian aid and fuel to be allowed into Gaza. We also urge the UK government to advocate for borders to open to allow access for civilians who need to reach safety. UK action should not contribute to the further forced displacement of Palestinians. In terms of what we can do to help practically, first we urge the UK Government to facilitate medical evacuation for those who need it. Scotland played a significant role in the evacuation of people during the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts and we can do so again. Second, the UK should plan now to scale up the existing UK Resettlement Scheme in partnership with the UN Refugee Agency, to allow an emergency pathway for people fleeing the region, especially for the most vulnerable, such as children and families, those with severe health needs, as well as those with existing links to residents in Scotland. The UK needs to activate its current resettlement system and expand it to deal with humanitarian crises like we are seeing in Gaza or in other troubled parts of the world, rather than create a discrete protection route in response to each crisis. We need systems that are proactive and pre-emptive rather than reactionary. Third, we call on the UK government to rapidly resolve the protection applications of people from Israel and Palestine who are already in the UK’s asylum system as well as those who are stateless. Lastly, current family reunion schemes should be made more accessible and faster to allow people affected directly by this humanitarian crisis to be with their family in Scotland and the UK. This is an emergency. The UK should act. These calls are part of a wider appeal for the UK government to invest in a fair and efficient asylum system that works for everyone. These systems should be centred around the person’s protection needs not their nationality, race, or how they arrived here. The tragic circumstances unfolding in Gaza demonstrate so clearly the importance and value of the life-saving Refugee Convention. We continue to stand ready to help anyone who is forced to flee the region and we will support the Scottish Government in these efforts.

Scottish Refugee Council,Standing up for refugee rights,23-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/standing-up-for-refugee-rights/,"We’re determined to make life better for people seeking safety in Scotland. Here’s how we’re standing up for refugee rights. Supporting people in desperate need In the last year we have supported more than 350 people facing homelessness and destitution, helping them access mental health services, get legal advice and find food, clothing and homelessness support. Read more about how we’re helping people in crisis. Raising awareness about refugee rights More than 480 frontline workers from 44 organisations, including charities, universities and local councils came to our training courses on refugee and asylum rights Over 100 teachers and support staff received our resources on the education rights of children seeking safety Find out more about our training courses Making recruitment fairer and more accessible Last year, 87 people from various sectors attended our employer training sessions about making recruitment fairer and more accessible for candidates from refugee backgrounds. The seven sessions were delivered in partnership with Perth Chamber of Commerce and The Prince’s Trust . Campaigning for change We campaigned against the UK government’s unjust asylum policies – including the Nationality and Borders Act and the Illegal Migration Bill. As part of Together With Refugees – a coalition of more than 300 organisations from across the UK – we called for a fairer and more humane asylum system. We raised awareness about refugee and asylum issues by speaking out in more than 200 newspaper articles, radio interviews and TV shows. Rewarding responsible journalism We joined forces with the National Union of Journalists Scotland to host the Refugee Festival Scotland Media Awards 2022 celebrating fair, responsible and accurate journalism on refugee and asylum issues. The awards honour the vital work of journalists in building greater public empathy and understanding of the experiences of people affected by forced migration. Supporting people to share their stories Six people with lived experience of the refugee and asylum system helped us create a best practice photography guide for organisations working with refugees. 60 people seeking safety in Scotland received training and support to share their stories on their own terms. “ It’s so important that refugee voices are heard in the media because I realised that every time I speak out, things change. If we are all working towards positive change, we need to be bold enough to speak out.” – Comfort Anjorin, Storytelling Volunteer Author: Rachel Lamb Our impact"
Scottish Refugee Council,Reaching more people across Scotland,23-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/reaching-more-people-across-scotland/,"As Scotland’s national refugee charity, we’re committed to helping people in every part of the country feel safe and secure in their new communities. Last year, we supported more than 7,480 people seeking safety in 30 out of Scotland’s 32 local council areas. Here’s how we helped. Expanding our national helpline We expanded our national helpline to meet the growing need for support. Our multilingual advisers answered over 10,000 calls from people seeking urgent information and advice – more than double the previous year. “My experience with the Scottish Refugee Council Helpline was excellent I’m so lucky that I got help from them. The staff were very nice and kind to me. I can’t thank you more!” – Najwa “ I felt confused about the system. Scottish Refugee Council explained to me really well on the phone what my rights are. Thank you to them and their kindness ” – Salim Helping newly arrived families We supported 72 newly arrived families – including 144 children – to understand the complex asylum system and begin rebuilding their lives in Scotland. We’re there for parents and children at every step in their asylum journey, helping them access healthcare and education, find legal and financial support and make connections in their new communities. “The service is really, really helping me. My case manager goes the extra mile to resolve issues for me. She has been my strength in Scotland.” Find out how we’re offering newly arrived families a helping hand Responding to the war against Ukraine We helped shape Scotland’s emergency response to the war against Ukraine. Our amazing meet and greet volunteers welcomed more than 1,200 people at Glasgow airport. They also started a ‘chatty café’ so people in hotel accommodation could meet over a slice of cake to play games, practice speaking English and, most importantly, have fun. Soon after arriving in Scotland, Tetiana began volunteering to greet fellow Ukrainians. “The best thing is feeling that you are useful and can help somebody. I know how it feels when you come to a strange country for the first time. You don’t know what tomorrow will be or where you will stay. It’s really scary. “When I arrived, I was so scared. I had read about what to do but I didn’t know how it would be. It’s really great when there’s someone you can ask. Even more when they can speak to you in your own language.” In the last year, have helped 530 families fleeing the war against Ukraine to settle in communities across Scotland. We held regular information sessions, helping: 1,020 people from Ukraine understand their rights in Scotland 640 Scottish hosts find out how to welcome guests from Ukraine in their homes We also established five community networks connecting local services, councils and people from Ukraine, so they can work together to help new arrivals settle in. Nastasiya (not her real name) arrived from Ukraine last year. She told us: “I would like to thank you for your understanding, support and help. Moving to Scotland is a big challenge for each of us, but with your help we manage to integrate quickly.” Supporting more of Scotland’s most vulnerable children Last year, 743 unaccompanied children were helped to feel safe and secure by our Guardianship Scotland service, run in partnership with Aberlour Children’s Charity . And we’re set to help even more of the country’s most vulnerable young people. We’ve secured funding from the Scottish Government to provide every unaccompanied asylum-seeking and trafficked child in Scotland with an independent guardian to support them and speak up on their behalf. One of the young people supported by Guardianship Scotland said this about their guardian: “I knew I had somebody there I could trust. I knew I had someone there that I could open up and tell how I felt inside.” Author: Rachel Lamb Our impact Services"
Scottish Refugee Council,Helping refugees rebuild their lives,23-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/helping-refugees-rebuild-their-lives/,"Every year, we help hundreds of people who have been granted refugee status rebuild their lives in Scotland. The transition from asylum seeker, with very few choices about how and where you live, to refugee, with a raft of new rights and responsibilities, is not an easy one. We support people with everything from finding somewhere to live and a school for their children, to accessing social support, applying for travel documents and securing a place at college. Last year, we helped 639 households from 45 nationalities to find their feet after being granted refugee status in Scotland. And we worked with Dundee City Council to support an additional 300 people resettled in the region. Here’s how we helped new refugees in 2022-23: 454 people received housing advice to help them understand their rights and options 120 people enrolled in language classes to help improve their English 67 people were put in touch with partner organisations providing employment support 50 people got help to apply for travel documents and Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK Emine and Hamza’s story Emine and Hamza (not their real names) came to the UK in search of refugee protection after fleeing persecution. After nearly two years in the asylum system, they were finally granted refugee status. The couple came to us for help to settle in their new home. Emine explained: “When we learned that we could stay in Scotland we were so happy. To be accepted and hear that you can start to live when you have had problems in your own country is a beautiful thing.” We helped Emine and Hamza register with a GP, chase missing Universal Credit payments and connect with a local foodbank. When they experienced racist abuse, we reassured them and explained how to report a hate crime to the police. Without a support network of friends and family, Emine initially struggled. She felt isolated, lonely and depressed. We referred her to mental health services, arranged English classes for her and helped her apply for a place at college. She said: “I was pretty upset about the situation. I shared my thoughts with my advisor at Scottish Refugee Council and he asked what he could do to help. That was a big deal for me. I felt so much better. “After that good things started to happen. It felt like a door had opened. I started college. I started getting Universal Credit payments. I’m in a good place, so thank you for that.” We helped Emine and Hamza apply for travel documents so they can visit close friends and family who have also been forced to flee and are seeking refugee protection in Europe. Hamza explained: “In my country we face discrimination. Most people are not free to even move around in their own country and their passports are blocked. Many people are in jail for no reason. “When you are a refugee you are not that free to go to other countries because of the lack of travel documentation. We have friends and relatives we cannot visit. One close relative is in Germany. He got married and we couldn’t go to his wedding. “Today we are receiving our travel documents and we are so thankful for that. We leave as happy people. Now we can meet people that we know from before [we fled]. That is so important.” Before fleeing persecution, Emine worked as a nurse. She hopes to find similar work in Scotland so she can give something back to the country that has welcomed her. She had this advice for other people seeking safety in Scotland. “The process is long. It’s been three years for us to reach the situation we’re in. The most important advice I can give people is to be patient. Scottish Refugee Council has helped us a lot in this process. It is a big help to meet with people who are positive and guide you in the right direction. When you hear the words ‘What can I do to help?’ it’s so good.” Find out more about our support for new refugees Author: Rachel Lamb Our impact Services"
Scottish Refugee Council,Helping New Scots Succeed,22-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/helping-new-scots-succeed/,"When people in need of refugee protection reach Scotland, a new and difficult journey begins. We work with New Scots, partner organisations and grassroots groups across the country to help people thrive in their new communities. Here are some of the ways we’re helping people seeking safety succeed. Supporting new refugees Last year we helped 639 households from 45 different countries to find their feet after being granted refugee status in Scotland. Read more about how we’re supporting new refugees as they rebuild their lives. Helping refugees find work Over 200 people registered for our job fair to help refugees find work in Scotland. Eight organisations from sectors, including banking, social care, transport, skilled trade, food manufacturing and housing, had stalls at our event. We also worked with nine employers – including Barclays , Bell Group , Esteem Training , Fair Dea l, First Bus , IKEA , Macphie , St Andrew’s First Aid and Starbucks – to provide 78 refugees with training, mentoring and work placements. As a result of these partnerships, 23 people were offered permanent jobs. Burhan (not his real name) received training mentoring and advice to help him make sense of the UK job market: “This support put me on the right track with working in the UK and how best to use my skills. It also helped with my confidence and relationships. Before I could only get part-time jobs. I am now working full time as a Data Analyst. You are having a great impact on people’s lives, and I am a living example.” Hear from more people who are thriving in the work place. Empowering community leaders Big congratulations to the 14 people graduated from our New Scots Leadership Programme , run in partnership with Social Enterprise Academy . The programme helps people to make connections, build on their existing experience, and gain confidence in their ability to lead change for themselves and others. Some of our new graduates shared their thoughts on the programme: “When you learn how to listen effectively, how to make a good decision, how to communicate effectively and what is your learning style, you can save time and be focussed on the right thing.” “The programme has help me a lot to understand how important it is to be open minded, a good listener, to cooperate with others, to be a visionary leader and to dream and aim big.” “I feel better able to support the development of my community thanks to the connections I made during this course.” Find out more about our New Scots Leadership Programme Supporting arts and culture In countries where voicing opinions can place you in danger, artists, activists and writers are often at an especially high risk of censorship, imprisonment and persecution. Last year, our Cross Borders arts programme supported 48 musicians, writers, film makers, artists and community activists from refugee and migrant backgrounds through mentoring, training, collaboration and commission s. Zarah Saifey was one of 10 people to be awarded a grant of £1,000 and matched with a dedicated mentor providing one-to-one support: “I did not have the confidence to talk about [my creative writing] but after having sessions with my mentor, I realised I should continue my writing more seriously and even have thought of finding publishers.” We also collaborated with Edinburgh International Festival on Refuge , a two-week programme of theatre, dance, art and film, featuring 85 artists from 17 countries . Emma Hay, Programme Manager at Edinburgh International Festival worked with us to create the Refuge series. “Through the Refuge programme we engaged with a number of artists from across Scotland and beyond whose works consider themes of migration, identity and inclusion. “The majority of artists were entirely new to the International Festival programme. This collaboration allowed us to share with and learn from Scottish Refugee Council, how culture can be used not only as a tool for advocacy and discourse, but as an opportunity to create a welcoming society for those who come to live here.” Find out more about Cross Borders programme Super-volunteer, Comfort Anjorin said: “ I’ve been supported by Scottish Refugee Council in so many ways, from the Leadership and Mentoring programmes to volunteering in storytelling, podcasting, Refugee Festival Scotland and the Reaching New Scots Fund. They’ve been like a family to me. I recently received refugee status and they’ve been supporting me through that process.” Author: Rachel Lamb Arts and culture New Scots Our impact"
Scottish Refugee Council,Nothing about refugees without refugees,20-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/nothing-about-refugees-without-refugees/,"People with lived experience of the refugee and asylum system have a crucial role to play in helping us build a better future with refugees in Scotland. Here’s how people seeking safety helped shape our work last year. Afghan Citizens Information Service Our Afghan Citizens Information Service , supported more than 350 people fleeing the Taliban regime. The 12-month project was staffed by people from Afghanistan who are fluent in Dari and Pashto and have personal experience of rebuilding their lives in Scotland. Yalda Rasooli was one of the call handlers providing information and practical support by phone, email and WhatsApp. “I have experienced refugee life and know how challenging it is until you are fully integrated within your new community. Even a very small assistance is a great help to people in this situation.” “I can easily show empathy with newly-arrived people because I know how they are feeling and how difficult it is. When refugees receive proper guidance and their problems are addressed, that is very rewarding. The Ukrainian Collective We established a Ukrainian Collective , made up of 35 volunteers who have settled in communities across Scotland. Before their lives were turned upside down by the Russian invasion, they worked as lawyers, accountants, teachers, artists and entrepreneurs. Now they’re using their professional expertise and personal experience of seeking safety to advocate on behalf of fellow Ukrainians. The Collective is split into three working groups, each representing a key challenge for refugees: language and culture, housing, and employment. They discuss the difficulties faced by their communities and propose practical solutions to these problems. Their recommendations are now being shared with the Scottish Government, local authorities and other relevant bodies supporting the resettlement of Ukrainians in Scotland. Oleksandra Novatska chairs the Language and culture group. “I don’t just want to be part of society here. I want to help build a better society where all people can work, study, volunteer and use their skills to benefit others. When we feel part of society, we can make it better for everyone.” Reaching New Scots Fund Our refugee-led Reaching New Scots Fund awarded more than £800,000 to 35 community projects across Scotland. This innovative new approach to funding was designed and managed by 11 people from refugee backgrounds in partnership with The National Lottery Community Fund . Ronnie Tagwireyi was one of the volunteers leading on the project. “Funding is usually top down, it’s never been done by people who are refugees and asylum seekers themselves. So, it was great when there were 100-and-something applications. It was an overwhelming response. “I’m really glad I was a part of it. We showed that this can be done and hopefully it’s the start of a change in how funding works. Hopefully other funders can look at this participatory funding process – that people with lived experience are involved at every stage – as something so good from start to finish. That would be absolutely fantastic.” Learning and improving Six people with lived experience of the asylum system lead a research project to review the way we involve refugees in our work and suggest ways we can improve. Their recommendations will help us ensure that the skills, knowledge, and experiences of people seeking safety shape everything we do. A member of the research team told us: “Involving [people with lived experience] in projects means that people are not just seen as a commodity, as a number. They are seen as valued contributors to shaping and developing policies that impact them and those around them.” Author: Rachel Lamb Communities New Scots Our impact"
Scottish Refugee Council,Helping refugees find work in Scotland,20-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/helping-refugees-find-work-in-scotland/,"Looking for a job in a new country can be a real challenge. We provide training and support to help refugees find work in Scotland. Our short courses and one-to-one support help people understand the UK job market, identify transferable skills, create CVs and perfect their interview skills. We also work in partnership with employers from a wide range of sectors to help refugees make the most of their skills and experience in the workplace. Last year, we partnered with Barclays , Bell Group , Esteem Training , Fair Dea l, First Bus , IKEA , Macphie , St Andrew’s First Aid and Starbucks to offer 78 New Scots mentoring, training and work placements. We’re delighted that 23 people went on to secure permanent jobs as a result. All names in the stories below have been changed. Burhan’s story Despite his skills and experience in the technology sector, Burhan struggled to find work in Scotland. We offered him a place on a mentoring programme, run in partnership with Barclays. Burhan was matched him with a mentor from a similar skills background and given training and advice to help him make sense of the UK job market. “This support put me on the right track with working in the UK and how best to use my skills. It also helped me with my confidence and my relationships. First, I was given help with my CV. They provided a first draft and we worked on it together – it was a gamechanger. “After a few months I was enrolled in the Barclays mentoring programme and it was amazing from all perspectives. I couldn’t be more grateful. The support helped me get my first job, and then a better job after that. “I am now working full time as a Data Analyst. Before I could only get part-time jobs. We were able to get a better house. I can never be thankful enough. You are having a great impact on people’s lives and I am a living example.” Sofia’s story Sofia was offered a place on IKEA’s UPPNÅ programme , which helps refugees gain skills and employment. After completing an eight-week paid work placement she was offered a permanent job at the IKEA store in Glasgow. “I had applied for so many vacancies and got no reply. The training programme with IKEA was so helpful and made all the difference – for me, it was the main thing. It was the first time I had taken part in this type of programme so all of it was really helpful even though there were some things that I already knew. Still now, I remember a lot of things that I learned. “I now work for IKEA in Edinburgh as we have moved there. I was able to transfer my job from Glasgow to Edinburgh and stay with IKEA. The placement gave me more confidence and, because of the job, I have improved my English. Now I feel I can change my future and achieve what I want.” Amir’s story We helped Amir with a free place on an English Language course, so he could start his Masters degree in Manufacturing Engineering at Glasgow Caledonian University. We also arranged a three-day paid work placement for him with ingredient manufacturer, Macphie. Amir was offered a permanent job at the company’s Uddingston factory. He was quickly promoted and is thriving in his new role. “When looking for a job, the biggest challenge was always the interview. It was a bit of a nightmare. When you’re not a native speaker it’s really hard. I’ve been to many, many interviews and they didn’t go well. It’s very frustrating. “Scottish Refugee Council arranged for us to do three trial days at Macphie. They explained the job and what’s involved so it was very clear what would happen. The trial was perfect. It gave me a chance to try the job and see if it was good for me. I agreed to the contract and started working as a Production Operator. “After a month, I had an interview to change roles. I moved from an entry level Production Operator to a Continuous Improvement Officer. That’s what I’m qualified in. The interview for that role was great! I was more confident with the company and the guys there know you from the month of working. They know what you’re like and if you’re a hard worker.” Kemal’s story After completing our four-day training course with IKEA, Kemal was offered an eight-week paid work placement. He was soon given a permanent position. Kemal works part-time while studying towards a degree in electrical engineering. He also helps other refugees who are looking for work by sharing his employment journey with them. “When I left home, I was 17 and it was a really stressful time. I had to move to different countries and was really thankful to be able to settle safely in Scotland. I just wanted to be a good person, making a positive contribution to the society I lived in. “My placement with IKEA started in July 2021. The first job was in the Recovery department, and I really enjoyed that. I was keen to learn and it was a friendly environment. The managers and team leaders were great and very supportive in my work journey. “I was nominated as IKEA Co-Worker of the Year in 2022.  I am the leader of a group there which supports people from ethnic minority backgrounds. If it hadn’t been for this programme, I don’t think I would have had this chance. It boosted my confidence and has helped me achieve what I wanted. “What Scottish Refugee Council can offer is a life-changer. For people who are in the position I was in, I would say that getting connected and involved with Scottish Refugee Council is the best thing to do. It’s a cycle: one day you might be getting support yourself and then you can help others. Now I have the chance to give the same support to other people.” Find out more about our work to help refugees find employment in Scotland Author: Rachel Lamb Employment Our impact"
Scottish Refugee Council,Volunteering is a lifeline for people in the asylum system,20-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/volunteering-is-a-lifeline-for-people-in-the-asylum-system/,"Volunteering can be a lifeline for people trapped in the asylum system who are prevented from finding paid work. We hold monthly Volunteering Information Afternoons for refugees and people seeking asylum. The sessions are an opportunity for people to find out more about the benefits of volunteering and meet with organisations looking for volunteers. Becoming a volunteer not only helps reduce boredom and isolation, it enables people to make connections, build confidence and play a positive role in their new communities. Christina’s story Christina Haddad started volunteering with Greater Pollok Services after attending one of our Volunteering Information sessions. She quickly became an important part of the organisations volunteering team. Volunteering with Greater Pollok Services gives Christina a chance to make use of her skills and qualifications to help people in her local area. She runs the Planting Healthy Habits cooking initiative, preparing meals for residents using produce grown in the community gardens. She also volunteers in the Pollok Pantry, helping to tackle food poverty and food waste. Courtney Thomas from Greater Pollok Services said: “Christina is an asset to Greater Pollok services. She continues to support new volunteers and has encouraged other people to take part in our gardening sessions. We look forward to working with Christina in future projects.” We caught up with Christina to find out more about her experiences as a volunteer Thanks for sharing your story Christina. Can you tell us a bit about the Scottish Refugee Council’s Volunteering Information Afternoons? I found the volunteer information session to be very useful. It presented me with different volunteer opportunities in Glasgow that I was not aware of previously, and were not advertised through other networks I had already explored. The different volunteer groups attending were also quite diverse and catered to different interests. What do you do as a volunteer with Greater Pollok Services? I’m studying for a MSc in Food Security. Greater Pollok Services were able to find volunteering opportunities for me at a food pantry and at a community garden. They also tasked me to run the ‘Planting Healthy Habits’ cooking project, providing locally sourced, healthy meals to over 100 people in the Greater Pollok area. This initiative involved cooking meals using produce from the community gardens and distributing them to residents. Also guiding people in the community on how to cook meals at home and encourage the development of healthier eating habits on a budget. What advice would you give to someone with lived experience of the refugee and asylum system who is interested in becoming a volunteer? Use your cultural background and experience as an asset. Don’t hide them, use them to your advantage and use them to support others. What’s the best thing about volunteering? My favourite thing about volunteering would be engaging with and getting to know people. The people I volunteer with have helped me feel supported and well surrounded in a country I was new to. I was able to build friendships, but also build a network which would be useful for my career in Food Security. I also love meeting and connecting with people from the area, learning more about Glasgow and the Pollok area specifically. Meeting people from a similar background to mine is especially rewarding, as I get to offer them more individualized support because of our shared experience. I would like to thank every member of the Greater Pollok Service team. Everyone has been very welcoming and helpful (not just to me, but to all the new volunteers!). I can really see and appreciate the impact they have on the community, and how it is all done in such a positive and honest way. I am really proud to be part of their team! Our volunteering Information Afternoons are held on the last Thursday of every month except December. They are open to refugees and people at all stages of the asylum process.

Scottish Refugee Council,Reimagine: New Scots art exhibition in Perthshire,19-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/reimagine-new-scots-art-exhibition-in-perthshire/,"Reimagine: an exhibition of work by participants on the New Scots creative arts residency in Perthshire. Nestled away in the Perthshire countryside, people who have sought sanctuary in Scotland have been taking part in a creative arts project run by the Bield at Blackruthven. We visited their residency earlier this year . This month, the group has come back together to exhibit their work. The exhibition will run until 20th October. Liz Crichton, Art Facilitator and Pastoral Team Member at Bield at Blackruthven, shared her experience of working with the artists. The artists who have been taking part in our residency came back together at the beginning of October for an exhibition. This was a wonderful celebration of their work, and of their success and determination to restart their lives in this new country, separated from their families, despite what was happening in their homeland. Each artist was asked to write about their work. Their statements spoke of the way in which through making art they have been able to express themselves better, how painting helps to ‘bring calm’ when difficult things are happening, and some work was an expression of the welcome and sense of safety that they have felt since arriving in Scotland. A beautiful costume made by Kseniia is about finding ‘courage’ in adversity and being ‘brave’.  Other artists spoke of how the creative process had been a transformative experience, about moving from a sense of hopelessness to a more hopeful and romantic mood. For Valentyna, their work helped them to identify “what limits myself to move forward with my life” and subsequently being able to make drawings “created by her heart”. Another artist, Bilal wrote that his “art reflects the impact of displacement and the discovery of new horizons. It fosters a sense of connection and empathy across borders”. All of these statements demonstrate just how far the artists have come since we last met with them in February, both in their confidence in their work, and their ability to articulate what is happening for them in their creative process. The exhibition has been well received by our visitors, who have described it as “poignant and beautiful”, “inspirational and thought provoking”, “impressive and emotional”.  It is clear from the comments written, that it has fostered a deeper empathy among the local population for those who are displaced, their hardships, struggles and bravery. The exhibition will conclude on Thursday 19th October with a playback theatre performance, to formally recognise and honour all that has happened and the transformations that have taken place. The relationships made will continue long beyond the conclusion of this formal part of the programme. The New Scots Creative Artists Residency was funded by the Reaching New Scots Fund , developed in partnership with the National Lottery Community Fund . Author: Chris Afuakwah Communities"
Scottish Refugee Council,Q&A: Concerns over huge number of people at risk of homelessness in Glasgow,16-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/glasgow-homelessness-refugees-whats-happening/,"We’re really concerned about the huge numbers of people at risk of homeless in Glasgow this winter. More and more families and individuals are reaching out to us for help because they have been made homeless after receiving their refugee status. In this Q&A, we list some of the reasons for this crisis and what we’re doing about it. What’s happening? A large number of people seeking refugee protection are at risk of homelessness this winter. 1,400 people are expected to need help with housing in Glasgow before Christmas. Why are we worried? We have seen an increase in families and individuals reaching out for help because they have been made homeless after receiving their refugee status. We know of cases where families have had to resort to sleeping in police stations as they have nowhere else to go. Amidst the cost-of-living and housing crises, it would be difficult for anyone in Scotland to find new housing in a week. For someone who has just received their refugee status, it is impossible. People are not allowed to work while their asylum claim is processed. As a result, people who have just been granted their status are unlikely to have any savings for a deposit or rent. There is a 35-day delay between applying for Universal Credit and receiving the first payment. The UK government’s own Homelessness Reduction Unit says that at least 56 days are usually needed to find accommodation. There is a shortage of available, affordable housing. As we head into winter, we are deeply concerned for the welfare of refugees who will receive their status over the next few weeks and months. Why has it happened? The Home Office is speeding up its attempts to clear the asylum system ‘backlog.’ As part of this, it has sped up the decision-making process for people from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen. Unfortunately, due to recent protocol changes from the Home Office, people are being given just 7 days, or sometimes less, to find new accommodation once they have been granted their refugee status. What are we asking the UK and Scottish governments to do? We are urging the Scottish Government to provide the funding needed for councils to support and house people seeking sanctuary. We are asking the UK government to immediately reverse the changes so all refugees have a minimum of 28 days before they’re required to leave their accommodation. Read more on our asks to UK government here. What should you do if you’ve just been granted refugee status and are concerned or need support? If you are concerned or are looking for support, you can call our free and confidential helpline on 0808 1967 274 or use the ‘contact us’ section on our website.

Scottish Refugee Council,New Scots Leaders: Mohammed’s story,10-Oct-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/new-scots-leaders-mohammeds-story/,"On Wednesday 11th October, we are launching the latest round of our New Scots Leadership programme! We coordinate the programme in partnership with Social Enterprise Academy. 16 leaders from refugee backgrounds will come together twice a month to develop strategic leadership skills and be encouraged to put them to good use within their communities in Scotland. Mohammed is a graduate of last year’s leadership programme. This is his story. Mohammed is an engineer from Sudan, who arrived in Scotland in March 2022. He found out about the New Scots Leadership programme from a friend at Maryhill Integration Network . Honestly, when he advised me to enrol in the programme, I thought it was somewhere I could make some friends or spend time as I wasn’t working, because I wasn’t allowed to work at that time, based on the [right to work] regulation. So, I didn’t come with big hopes about the programme. But when I talked to [my fellow leaders] on the first day, I told them I have a goal. To do this goal, I should do whatever it takes. During the programme itself, honestly, I enjoyed the journey. After the Leadership programme concluded, the group had the opportunity to connect with Scottish Government employees for a three-month mentorship programme . She guided me well, and she advised me to visit some places. Getting somebody talk to you from a professional side is different. Whenever I met her, I enjoyed the discussion. It’s been fully about what’s going on, what things I would love to do in the future, which is related to sustainability and renewable energies. He was partnered with a mentor who works in sustainable and renewable energy. They are still in touch even after the project has ended. I don’t know about the others, but myself, I enjoyed it. It’s not about the certificate at all. But the program itself, it’s truly valuable to me. Even today I have talked to Karen. I told her I’ve been engaged with many employers right now. This partnership has led to Mohammed connecting with industry experts in civil engineering and sustainable energy, and getting interviews for work. I have more than 15 years in experience in this field, but I’m new here, so I need somebody to guide me. Right now, as I said, I’m more confident. I really have more connections. I can help others right now. During the journey, you will find a lot of doors are open. You will find many places you can visit for myself. As I said I’m from an engineering background, so I have visited Mott MacDonald [the civil engineering firm], I have sat with the sustainability director, engaged with them. He connected me with Scottish Power, I have been connected with WorleyParsons/Jacobs. They didn’t offer a position, but at least I have gathered enough information about what’s necessary to get a job here from my field. How you can approach an interview; what people expect from you, from a technical side, from habits, as a leader, as a management approach. I’ve done many interviews now, I’m more confident than I was when I started the program. And I can say that it’s not just by talk, it’s by action. I’ve gained friends in the sustainability field in Edinburgh and also in Glasgow, two or three organisations have been invited and I have seen and met them. Honestly, if I didn’t enrol in this program, I would not be at this point. Maybe I would reach my goals, but it would be harder. If you don’t get somebody guiding you or somebody helping you. I want to be engaged with the community, I want to know what is required to get a job because I’m an experienced guy. Mohammed has also recently received good news from University of Glasgow. One of my colleagues from the programme, Mohammed, advised me to apply for a scholarship with the Glasgow University. I think he’s just finished his Masters in Linguistics. I haven’t been selected in this scholarship for, uh, for Asylum Seeker and Refugee. But I found a way to contact the MBA programme recruitment manager and I have given him a statement about my situation and the things last year and why I need this program and what I’m going to do in a future for this country through this programme. In July, I’ve been granted the MBA scholarship from the business school itself. All this great news or benefits I have gained has came from doing this programme, whether it’s directly or indirectly. This programme has opened my eyes for the situation on the life here in Glasgow. So I’m really grateful for this program. I’m really happy with the friendships I got with everyone. In September 2023, Mohammed received an enticing job offer. However, he made the exciting choice to pursue his MBA program first. His plan? To reach out to the employer once he completes his studies, ensuring that he not only can secure the job now but also bring a newfound confidence, armed with MBA skills, to his future career. Mohammed has been helping us, and Social Enterprise Academy, with the recruitment of the latest cohort of the New Scots Leadership Programme. The course will begin on Wednesday 11 th October. Congratulations on all your successes, Mohammed. We can’t wait to hear what you get up to next! Image: Open Aye Author: Chris Afuakwah"
Scottish Refugee Council,Scottish Refugee Council Receives Investing in Volunteers Award,27-Sep-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/investing-in-volunteers-award/,"We are delighted to announce that Scottish Refugee Council has received the Investing in Volunteers Award for 2023-2026. The award is the UK quality standard for good practice in volunteer management. It is presented to organisations that meet a set of rigorous criteria. Volunteer co-ordinator Gün Orgun said: “Our volunteers are the heart and soul of work. They play a vital role in supporting people seeking safety in Scotland. We are committed to providing our volunteers with the best possible experience. This award is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our staff and volunteers.” The Investing in Volunteers Award acknowledges our ongoing commitment to our volunteers. We are incredibly grateful to each of them for their dedication and support. Head of Funding Development, Flutura Shala said: “This is a great achievement for us. It acknowledges the contribution of our charity to volunteering as well as ensuring that we continue to reflect and improve the quality of experience for all amazing volunteers joining us.” The award also recognises our dedication to supporting people with lived experience with volunteering opportunities . Volunteering can be a real lifeline for people in the asylum process, who are not able to work. It can help people make connections, contribute to their communities and make a positive difference. Volunteering can also reduce boredom and isolation and gives people a chance to make use of their existing skills and experience, as well as to learn new things. Christina Haddad began volunteering with Greater Pollok Services after attending one of our volunteering information afternoons for refugees and people in the asylum system. She told us: “My favourite thing about volunteering is engaging with and getting to know people. The people I volunteer with have helped me feel supported and well surrounded in a country I was new to and to build friendships, but also to build a network that would be useful for my career.” Another volunteer with lived experience of the asylum system, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I wanted to help [Scottish Refugee Council] as a volunteer because they helped me so much. Very quickly, they made me feel a member of the family.” Find out more about volunteering with Scottish Refugee Council here Author: Laura Delaney Volunteers"
Scottish Refugee Council,Afghans in Scotland: “Life here is not getting better for us”,21-Sep-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/afghans-in-scotland-life-here-is-not-getting-better-for-us/,"Elhan Afzal is a photojournalist and storyteller supported by our Cross Borders mentoring programme . He is currently living in Glasgow after fleeing Afghanistan. In this article, he speaks with fellow Afghans about their experience of being resettled in the UK. Afghans in Scotland: “Life here is not getting better for us” Once again another empire has fallen into a grave in the graveyard of Afghanistan. United States armed forces and the British Army failed in Afghanistan after fighting for more than 20 years. The last soldier, Christopher Donahue, left Afghanistan during the United States’ withdrawal on 30 August 2021. The city of Zarang, in the district of Nimruz, was the first provincial capital which fell into Taliban hands. They started taking control of provinces back to back, and Kabul was the last largest city which Taliban took control of. Embassies were emptied, offices where foreigners worked were closed, NGOs were temporary closed. Between 14 and 31 August 2021, United States Armed Forces and the British Army evacuated approximately 123,000 Afghans via Kabul International Airport (known as Hamid Karzai International Airport), including US citizens, SIV (special immigration visa), United Kingdom citizens, and those who served British government in past 20 years in Afghanistan. The United Kingdom government said that approximately more than 15000 Afghans were moved to the country from Afghanistan in the chaos at Kabul in August 2021. Since then, 7000 more Afghans have been relocated, including British nationals. The Home Office recently announced that 9000 Afghans have been moved to their permanent address or are waiting to be moved in. Over 8000 are still living in temporary accommodation in hotels. Half of them are kids. Ghulam’s story Ghulam Jan Qadery, 44y, a British National who was in Kabul when Taliban took control of Kabul, flew with his family during the chaos from Kabul International Airport to UK. He is currently living in temporary accommodation, a hotel in Aberdeen. He shares his experience of facing the Taliban: After the collapse of previous government in Afghanistan we were informed by FCDO office to find our way through baron hotel for possible evacuation. The security situation on the way to the airport was the most difficult and shocking moment which I will never forget in my life. The Taliban were everywhere with their guns pointing at our kids, women. They were even shooting people right in front of us . During our conversation, Ghulam explained the problems which he and his family have faced in the past 2 years staying at the hotel. It was a really bad experience since the chaos happened in Kabul. That’s even worse since two years we are staying in this hotel but the Home office wasn’t able to find us permanent accommodation. They must provide permanent accommodation for the Afghan who stayed in Hotels for almost two years, which is a long time. We can’t take it anymore. The hotel environment is not suitable for families specifically if they have kids. There are lots of noises and so overcrowded for families which make it difficult for us to live. Hamida’s story Hamida Hussaini, 27y, left Afghanistan and travelled to Pakistan. She then moved to UK, and is currently living in Glasgow with her husband and son. She was an employee of the British government in Afghanistan. It was really annoying situation to experience Taliban, but luckily we got the chance to be moved here by UK government and we are very happy, but life here is not getting better for us, there are many barriers which we have, because of them the time is hard on us. The Great Empire of the United Kingdom is all set to make Afghan refugees homeless. Earlier this year, Afghan refugees received an official letter from the Home Office telling them to leave hotels in the coming three months. The deadline for many was August. If they have nowhere to go, they will be on the streets. Words and photographs by Elhan Afzal. Author: Chris Afuakwah Afghanistan Arts and culture"
Scottish Refugee Council,"Seven days to find a new home: unreasonable, unfair and completely unrealistic",20-Sep-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/seven-days-to-find-a-new-home-unreasonable-unfair-and-completely-unrealistic/,"Thousands of people in Glasgow and across the UK face potential homelessness and destitution after a change of practice from the Home Office and its accommodation providers. Action to speed up long-delayed asylum applications is leading to an increased number of people receiving decisions about their right to safety. While this in itself is welcome, the Home Office is at the same time giving some people just seven days to move out of their asylum support accommodation, with no other housing or financial support in place. Previously, people had up to twenty eight days to prepare to leave their asylum accommodation and find somewhere new to live. We know from experience that even then, it was an extremely stressful and pressured four weeks for people to find a new place to live, relocate and switch to a whole new system of rights and benefits. It was very tough to achieve this in twenty eight days. It is virtually impossible to do so in seven days. Our Head of Asylum, Wafa Shaheen said: “We’ve seen the number of people coming to us for support double over the last month. But there is no doubling in the number of flats or houses available for people. There is a sense of panic and disbelief that people are expected to find somewhere new to live within such a short timescale. It’s unrealistic, unreasonable and almost designed to set people up to fail, particularly in the middle of a chronic housing shortage and cost of living crisis.” While some people we work with are receiving seven-day notices to quit their accommodation, others are receiving twenty-one and twenty-eight day notices, adding to the confusion. Earlier this month we j oined 140 organisations in a letter to the Home Secretary , urging the government to abandon the policy. Key recommendations include: Commit to immediately reverse the changes so all refugees have a minimum of 28 days before they’re required to leave their accommodation. Ensure that refugees receive all their documentation before the 28-day notice period begins, in line with recent Home Office policy. Issue clear guidance to local authorities that a newly recognised refugee is at risk of homelessness once they receive notification of the decision on their asylum claim, and are eligible for homelessness prevention support from that time without the need for evidence such as an eviction letter. Stagger the 7-day notices that people are now receiving and work with statutory services and civil society organisations to manage the increase in demand for support. Commit to working towards extending the move-on period to at least 56 days, in line with the Homelessness Reduction Act and the application for Universal Credit. We are also working with accommodation providers, Glasgow City Council and other partners to try to  urgently find housing for people in need. If you are concerned about accommodation or any other issue relating to your asylum claim, please call our free helpline for info and advice: 0808 196 7274 If you’re able to, please consider supporting our work to build a better future with refugees in Scotland.

Scottish Refugee Council,Anna’s story,15-Sep-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/annas-story/,"Anna Molman is a fantasy, sci-fi, romance and mystery writer from Ukraine. She arrived in Scotland with her son in May 2022. Actually, I’m not writing right now, I’m translating my own novels to English. But it’s the same, interesting and exciting. Translating some special phrases, it’s not so easy but it’s quite exciting. I like to do it. One of my books is self-published on Amazon. The other is not available now but I just sent it to a publishing house and I’m waiting for their response. I’m not writing something new right now, but I’m collecting all of my experiences of living here for the future, and I hope to create lots of interesting plots and stories after being here. The war in Ukraine made it difficult for Anna to access the healthcare she needed, so she had to leave. I have diabetes and there was a problem with insulin in my country when the war started. I also have a son, he is 11 now, and my big fear was that I wouldn’t be able to cover him with my body in time during air attacks. So as soon as Great Britain – thank you so much – gave us this opportunity, we found a sponsor and came here. So we live here quiet, cosy and safe. My son is at primary school and he likes the school. Everything is ok, for now. I have an interesting job, helping other Ukrainian refugees to find a job they like. And we are just excited about Scotland. Beautiful country, such pretty views and the climate is absolutely brilliant. When I say I like the weather, Scottish people are laughing for some reason! I don’t know why. But we like the weather here and the people here, you guys are very friendly and kind and thank you so much for being our hosts. Anna is a mentee on our Cross Borders mentoring programme . Her career began in 2019, when she wrote her first novel, Tango of Water and Flame. Now she has 11 novels written in her native language, 19 short stories and 15 fairy tales. Two of her novels and five of her short stories have been translated into English.

Scottish Refugee Council,Film screening: On our Doorstep,14-Sep-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/film-screening-on-our-doorstep/,"The first Scottish screening of 2021 film On our Doorstep will take place at Cameo Picturehouse, Edinburgh, on Wednesday 27th September. The film will be followed by a Q&A with director Thomas Laurance, alongside some of our team and community members. Tickets are £11.10/£9.60 (concession). Book your tickets here . About On our Doorstep. On our Doorstep follows the grassroots movement that sprung up to support people displaced in the Calais Jungle, before its demolition in October 2016. Ordinary civilians were able to provide aid to 10,000 people where NGOs could not, and two governments would not. Volunteers, often young and relatively inexperienced, but with a shared sense of responsibility, worked tirelessly to improve the living conditions of refugees in Northern France; only to find themselves in the middle of a political race to the bottom, dealing with emotional turmoil, ethical dilemmas, and the eventual destruction of the space they’d created. The film recognises the ordinary civilians supporting people who have fled conflict and persecution, and does not shy away from asking difficult questions – whether the volunteers achieved their aims, and whether the needs of refugee communities were met. Across the world, whether at hostile borders, saving people at sea, or in local communities, ordinary people are stepping up and finding ways to support people seeking refuge. This film recognises the huge challenges faced, but also the solidarity and hope this can provide, and how at times this support can really be the difference between life and death.

Scottish Refugee Council,Our mentoring project with Scottish Government,04-Sep-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/mentoring-project/,"We have been delighted to work with Scottish Government this year, to support alumni from our Leadership programme to connect and network with employees from different departments at Scottish Government. Shahid Khan, a Senior Policy Officer at Scottish Government who has lived refugee experience, worked with us, his colleagues and employer to open the doors for three months. The project was designed and delivered in partnership with Scottish Refugee Council and Scottish Government Refugee Allies Network. This mentoring project connected his colleagues with people seeking refugee protection in Scotland. Over the course of the pilot project, mentors and mentees met three times for one-to-one sessions. The group also took part in a tour of Scottish Parliament, and came together at the end of the project for a networking and evaluation event. The mentoring project was a great success. Not only was it an opportunity for our Leaders to gain insights into how Scottish Government works, but for Scottish Government employees to build their understanding of the issues facing people seeking refugee protection in Scotland. Participants, both mentors and mentees, expressed that they felt the project was a great success, and that they wished it could go on for longer. Comfort, one of our New Scots Leaders, said: I want this to continue and not end, because this will bring a lot of beauty, diversity, and a lot of support. And Scottish Government need to learn from us aswell, as refugees. We need to learn from each other and know what’s going on in the world. Rachael McLean, from Scottish Government, said, I feel privileged to have been part of the recent pilot mentoring programme for refugees in Scotland. It was humbling to work closely with my partner from whom I learned a huge amount, including about the varied challenges and obstacles that refugees face when trying to integrate into a new country Alison Byrne, Director for Equality, Inclusion & Human Rights and Scottish Government sponsor of the scheme said: It is incredibly powerful for civil servants to spend time listening, sharing and talking to the New Scots on the scheme, who bring a different lived experience, and diverse and rich backgrounds, skills and knowledge.  This is vital to inform our policy development, and influence our thinking about what it is to be Scottish, as well as build lasting friendships and connections at all levels of the Scottish Government.

Scottish Refugee Council,People seeking protection should not be forced to share rooms,24-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/asylum-forced-room-sharing-government/,"The Home Office has announced plans to require people seeking protection to share hotel rooms. We are not aware of this plan starting in Scotland yet, where over 1,200 people are currently housed in hotel rooms. But we are very clear that forcing people to share bedrooms with strangers is not okay. Everyone has the right to safe and adequate housing. These new measures could leave people in cramped conditions, without privacy, and could re-traumatise those who have fled violence, oppression and persecution. It is an appalling, inhumane and irresponsible way to treat people seeking safety. We urge the UK government to drop these plans. Forcing people to double up in temporary hotel rooms is not the answer. Neither are barges or army barracks. They should instead focus on creating a fair and efficient asylum system to clear the backlog of hundreds of thousands of people who have been left in limbo waiting for a decision on their right to remain here. If the current system were not so broken by the UK government, policies like forced bedroom sharing would not be being considered. This week , Scottish politicians spoke out against the plan. We now urge the First Minister to intervene and instruct his government to identify and pursue all legal and policy options to stop bedroom sharing happening in Scotland. If you are affected by the plans or need any information or advice about your situation, please call our free and confidential helpline on 0808 196 7274 Read more about our response to inappropriate accommodation.

Scottish Refugee Council,Afroscots United: Champions on and off the pitch!,21-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/afroscots-united-champions-on-and-off-the-pitch/,"Afroscots United are the champions of the Scottish Unity Football League 2022-23! Afroscots United football club was set up in 2005, and it has grown from strength to strength. The team’s ethos is to encourage social inclusion and promote appreciation and understanding of diverse cultures in Scotland, through the power of sport. They work in deprived and hard to reach areas, working to get people involved in mainstream society. The team also host social and cultural events to help integrate people from different backgrounds and promote the many diverse cultures within their community. And they raise awareness of health-related issues affecting their community. They meet twice a week, for trainings on Friday evenings and competitive league games on Sundays. The team is home to many people with lived experience of seeking refuge in Scotland. Evarista Bembo, who runs the team, says: We assist them and help them feel part of a team and this is valuable as it helps them with their mental and physical well-being. Our team is the first one to start helping footballers from ethnic minorities get their break in the Scottish game, we have been doing this for more than a decade and there are many success stories from refugees having a good career in football through our team. Last year only we had more than 10 boys signed by semi professional clubs, we had helped the likes of Joe Bevan seal his move to Albion Rovers first team and he now is their main striker, Michael Semirimu came from us and he is the Albion Rovers reserve team captain now…. Siriki Dembele plays now for Birmingham City Fc in England, he played for us when he was in Scotland and we kept pushing him and helped him to believe in himself and he is now a top professional and a great example to the community. And just this week, our captain Arnie Kasa has been signed by Albion Rovers . Their Scottish Unity League win is their third trophy this season, following wins at the Summer Cup and Paul Kelly Celebration Cup. They have finished top of the league with 6 points and 14 goals more than the 2nd placed team in the league table. Great work! Best of luck to all the players for the coming season. If you are interested in joining Afroscots United or finding out more, they are always happy to welcome more people. You can contact them via their social media channels .

Scottish Refugee Council,Rebuilding lives one step at a time,15-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/rebuilding-lives-one-step-at-a-time/,"Farzana, one of our Refugee Integration Advisers, has a wealth of experience in supporting refugees and displaced people. Before coming to Scotland in 2021, she worked for the Linda Norgrove Foundation in Afghanistan, where she helped provide education and health care for vulnerable women and children. Now she is using her lived experience to help people arriving in Scotland settle into their new communities step-by-step. Tell us a bit about your job I’ve been working as a Refugee Integration Advisor for almost 14 months now. My role is to provide information to newly recognised refugees, advocate on their behalf, and support them in the integration process. I also refer people to other agencies and organisations that can help them with anything from finding a job, registering with a GP, or applying for benefits. Ultimately, my goal is to help people integrate well into the community and make social connections. How long have you worked for Scottish Refugee Council and what drew you to the organisation? I started in June 2022. When I came to the UK in 2021 everything was new and uncertain for me. I had a strong fear that I would make the wrong choices. That I would offend someone because of our different cultures. I wanted to be accepted, to be part of society. In the beginning it was so stressful and the only people I knew were my manager and people from the foundation I worked for. Their support and encouragement made me think “how do other people face these challenges?” One of my friends told me about a job at Scottish Refugee Council to support people. I was hesitant at first because I didn’t think I had the knowledge or experience. I was afraid that I wouldn’t know enough to help others, but I tried my luck and applied anyway. I have been through the refugee process myself, so I know how overwhelming it can be. I wanted to use my experience to help others who are going through the same thing. I want to put people at ease and give them hope. Sometimes when I explain the process to clients, they take a deep breath of relief and say, “thank you.” What’s the best thing about working for Scottish Refugee Council? There are actually two things that I love about my job. First, I find it very rewarding to see people make progress in their integration journey. Even the smallest steps can make a big difference, and it’s always great to see people feeling more confident and independent. For example, one of my clients who I have been working with for two months was very uncertain at first and had intermediate English. But, when I spoke to her this morning, I learned that she had registered with her GP and dentist on her own. She has also applied for college because she wants to become a teacher in the long run. And she has applied for nursery for her child. It is amazing to see her confidence progress. It feels very satisfying to me. Second, I love working with my team. We’re all very supportive of each other, and I know that I can always count on them for help. Working from home can be challenging at times, especially when I have a difficult conversation with a client or am asked a question I don’t know the answer to. However, I can always get in touch with my line manager, Karolina, or one of my colleagues. They are always kind and supportive, and I wouldn’t survive without them. What’s the most challenging thing about your role? The most challenging thing is managing expectations. When people first get their status in the UK, they often have high hopes and want to do everything fast. They want to grow and engage in the community. I have to be honest with them about the challenges that they will face, but I also want to give them hope and encouragement. However, the reality is that it takes time to learn a new language, understand a new culture, and build a new life. I have to remind them that it’s a long-term process. Also, refugee policies can be confusing to people because what they see on paper can be very different from what they experience in practice. What do you find most rewarding? The most rewarding thing about my job is seeing people take small steps and improve in their confidence. It’s amazing to see someone who was once feeling lost and overwhelmed start to feel more at home in their new community. It’s a privilege to be a part of that journey. What do you like to do when you’re not at work? When I’m not working, I love spending time with my family both in the UK and outside of the UK . I call my mum and dad and my siblings outside the UK because sometimes they are worried about me and I am worried about them. I let them know that I am fine. I also have a nephew here in Scotland who is two and a half and he is amazing. I love spending time with him. I love listening to music. Sometimes I listen to music in languages that I don’t understand, but I love the way the music makes me feel. I also enjoy taking walks around the castle grounds near my house. It’s a large, green space with lots of trees. It’s very quiet and peaceful, which I love. Find out more about our support for new refugees. Author: Laura Delaney staff stories"
Scottish Refugee Council,We must not forget Afghanistan,15-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/afghanistan-kabul-anniversary-uk-government/,"A message from our CEO, Sabir Zazai: It has now been two years since the fall of Kabul and the evacuation of Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, there are no opportunities for men and women under the new regime. People are fleeing for a numbers of reasons, including extreme poverty and real threats to life and livelihoods. Despite many promises from the government to help resettle Afghans in the UK, thousands are left in limbo. Some have been left waiting for over two years in neighbouring countries attempting the lengthy process of applying for visas, or are stuck in the increasingly hostile UK asylum process. After two years, there is still no process for the majority of Afghan refugees to reunite with family members who were left behind after the evacuation. For every Afghan person who arrived in the UK on a resettlement scheme in the year ending March 2023, almost 90 crossed the Channel in a small boat. Recent tragedies have shown how important it is for safe routes to be established, the government to follow through on resettlement promises, and families to be reunited. In January 2022 the Government opened the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), promising to resettle 5,000 Afghan refugees in the first year and 20,000 over the coming years.  Since this announcement, only 54 Afghans have been newly resettled in the UK on ACRS. The schemes are now seemingly dormant, despite a great need for them. The government’s Illegal Migration Act means that, despite formerly 98% of asylum claims from people from Afghanistan being granted, people now arriving via small boat, car or lorry will no longer be able to claim asylum, and will instead be subject to detention and removal. People fleeing the Taliban will have nowhere to turn. On top of this, over 9,000 Afghan men, women and children are still in temporary accommodation. These people are at risk of being evicted at the end of this month, with no formal plan in place for future accommodation. For people who have spent two years in temporary accommodation, their journey of community-based integration has not started yet. They have not been able to start to build their lives here and become part of their local communities. “The government has forgotten about these people” I recently visited an ex-hotel in Edinburgh where people from Afghanistan have been living for up to two years. I expected them to be frustrated at not having houses for them and their families. Instead, it was employment they wanted to talk about. They told me: ‘We worked for you during the war, why can we not work for you now?’ They are eager to work and provide for themselves. The government has forgotten about these people. Instead of becoming active parts of our society, their talents are being wasted. Two years on, the picture is very bleak. Both in terms of the UK’s response, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis. We call on the government to act swiftly in granting asylum to Afghans awaiting their decisions. We call on them facilitate family reunion and establish safe and legal safe routes for those fleeing the crisis. The UK needs to show leadership in terms of providing international aid. We all must work together. While we await action from the UK government, people are being forced to make impossible decisions, embark on treacherous journeys and be separated from their loved ones. People we promised to help. The least we can do is reach out, show compassion and help them to rebuild their lives with dignity, no matter how they arrived here. I do not want to us to reach a third anniversary where we are talking about the same things. People need protection now. Read more about our work helping Afghan communities Author: Gilly Furmage"
Scottish Refugee Council,Afghanistan two years on: Stories from New Scots,15-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/afghanistan-two-year-anniversary-refugees/,"This week marks the second anniversary of the evacuation of Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul. People who have come to Scotland have shared their stories of seeking sanctuary and making new lives thousands of miles from home. Abdullah’s* story Abdullah came to the UK last year with his wife and children after a long process of attempting to flee the Taliban. “While my visa was being processed – shots were fired at my car – it was a warning from the Taliban. Luckily no one was injured. The Taliban went to my home and told my father: ‘Your son was safe from the shards of the gunshots, the next time he will not be safe. You should bring him to us.’ “When we first got to Scotland we had many problems – financial issues, language barriers, course fees. We had to try and borrow money from family and friends. “My degree is not just a degree, it’s my dream, my future” “When we claimed asylum, we really didn’t know what to do. We received advice and support from the British Red Cross and the Scottish Refugee Council. I will never forget their help. They guided me on where to go, what my rights were and what help I could access. Abdullah is now studying towards a university degree: “My degree is not just a degree, it’s my dream, my future.” “This is the only year I have been jobless since I was 16. “I want a work permit. I want to take responsibility. I don’t need financial support from the UK, I want to earn money and support my family on my own. “The education system in Afghanistan is broken. It is very difficult for women – girls are not allowed to go to school. It gives me happiness for my wife and children to be in education. I want us to be an educated family. “I want us to be an educated family” “14 years ago my father was a refugee and came to the UK from Afghanistan. Now my family and I have been forced to do the same thing. I do not want my children to be in the same position when they are older.” Fazal’s* story Fazal has now been in Scotland for nearly two years after fleeing the Taliban with his family. He is a musician and is deeply passionate about traditional Afghan music. “Most of my colleagues were killed by the Taliban. We were forced to leave.” “I feel very safe here.” “I would love to play the National music of Afghanistan. I play the harmonium and would like to play a concert sharing our music. It is very different to the music here. I think many people do not understand. It is very different to Western pop music. I would love to share it with people.” Fazal plans to study towards becoming a driving instructor. Amir’s* story Amir and his family have now been in Scotland for two years. “Scotland is a great place… but it has cloudy weather. “I go to a cooking school that teaches us how to make Scottish foods. It teaches us how to cook, how to make soup and bake cakes. There are no lectures, just fun. It is nice to have Afghan men coming together. We will all be cooking, laughing, joining in. It is a joy.” *Names have been changed to protect contributors Read more about our work helping Afghan communities. Author: Gilly Furmage"
Scottish Refugee Council,Helping Afghan communities thrive,14-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/helping-afghan-communities-thrive/,"We’re thrilled to be launching a new project which will help Afghans in communities across Scotland to thrive. This project has been made possible thanks to £40,000 in funding from the Scottish Government . The money will be used to support grassroots groups and organisations run by and for people who have arrived in Scotland after fleeing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. By strengthening and building the capacity of these local groups, we aim to help New Scots from Afghanistan feel at home and play an active role in their new communities. We will do this by: Identifying and organising opportunities for people to take part in events and activities that help them make friends and feel connected in their local area Connecting local groups so they can meet, share ideas, learn from each other and work together to support communities Create an Afghan Collective, similar to our Ukraine Collective , made up of volunteers with lived experience who will represent and advocate for their communities at both a national and local level We will focus on communities in five key regions: Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverclyde, Inverness and Perth. We’ll also work closely with existing, well established organisations in Glasgow who have valuable experience of successfully forming groups and supporting local communities.

Scottish Refugee Council,Flying kites of hope for Afghans in Inverness,10-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/flying-kites-of-hope-for-afghans-in-inverness/,"Our communities team have been flying kites of hope for Afghans in Inverness. Farkhonda and Yalda, two of our Community Development Officers, visited High Life Highland in Inverness to attend a kite-making workshop with the Afghan community resettled in the Highlands. Kite-flying plays an important role in Afghan culture, and is an 800-year old tradition. Farkhonda and Yalda are both from Afghanistan themselves, and have been working with Scottish Refugee Council since early 2022, providing information to newly arrived Afghans in Scotland. They are now working more closely with New Scots women. After attending the kite-making workshop, which was originally scheduled as part of Refugee Festival Scotland , they reflected on the situation for Afghan families resettled in the Highlands. There are a small number of Afghan families living in Inverness and the surrounding areas. High Life Highlands supports these families with events and excursions, such as visits to the beach and horse riding, aswell as vital ESOL classes. Language classes are particularly appreciated, especially by women who were unable to study before they came to Scotland. Unfortunately, due to the weather, only two families made it to the kite-making event. The weather is the least of people’s worries, though. There are no mosques, they can’t find halal food, and it’s difficult to get childcare for large families who have five or six children. Some families are very remote and struggling to connect with any community or local services. People are enterprising, though. One person we spoke to is keen to set up a halal food business, if he can get financial support. Many of the women are interested in sewing classes and workshops. High Life Highland, and other groups in the area, are doing everything they can. But it is challenging. Small, rural communities, no matter how welcoming, don’t have the infrastructure in place to support people’s needs. Kite-flying won’t resolve these challenges, but it may offer some hope, respite and much-needed connection. Author: Chris Afuakwah Communities"
Scottish Refugee Council,Mykola’s story,01-Aug-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/mykolas-story/,"Mykola is from Kalanchak in the Kherson region of Ukraine, where he worked as a civil engineer, and in his retirement, a beekeeper. He and his wife are now living in Saltcoats. Kalanchak is the most northern point of Crimea, basically on the border to Crimea. From the start of the war, from the 24th February, we were under Russian occupation. So, on day one, we saw Russian tanks in our garden and we didn’t understand what is happening. Russian soldiers were getting into people’s homes. They were kicking them out and occupying the homes. That’s the reason we couldn’t stay there any longer, because the full area was under occupation. Mykola had lived in Kalanchak all his life. We were living under occupation for five months, and then we decided to get away from there. So we were trying to use different means of transport to get out of there. On the way out we were seeing the fights between the Ukrainian and Russian army and it was a very terrifying picture, not a nice thing to see. At the time of writing, the territory is still under Russian occupation. Mykola and his wife fled first to Poland, where their daughter lives. They then travelled to Scotland under the Super Sponsor scheme. We were living on the MS Ambition for 5 months and then the Scottish Government has arranged for us to move to Saltcoats. We are very happy with the accommodation we have been provided. I would like to say my appreciation to Scotland for all the support and care. We didn’t expect social housing, we are both pensioners and did not expect to receive so much support and help. We are living in very good conditions and really appreciate everything you have done for us. They have been exploring Scotland, and getting involved in their local community. We like to travel a lot. Me and my wife have been going to museums and nice places in Glasgow. We really like this country, it’s a beautiful country. We have started English classes. I’ve started volunteering in the community gardens in Ardrossan. I will be doing beekeeping. I’ve been a beekeeper in Ukraine for 15 years. I really like this profession. I am a civil engineer by profession. I started to do beekeeping not long before I reached pension age. I’ve got my own garden for the bees. I’ve got around 50 hives, a platform and I really enjoy doing this. I would like to say my appreciation towards the Council, Lucy and Callum, Scottish Government, everybody who has taken care of us, accepted us and greeted us with open hearts.

Scottish Refugee Council,The Ukrainian Collective,27-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/the-ukrainian-collective/,"People who have settled in Scotland after fleeing the war against Ukraine are using their skills and experience to suggest how refugee communities can be better supported. The Ukrainian Collective is made up of more than 30 volunteers living across Scotland, from the Highlands to the Borders. Before their lives were turned upside down by the Russian invasion, group members worked as lawyers, accountants, teachers, business owners and artists. Now they are drawing on their professional expertise and personal experiences of seeking safety to advocate on behalf of fellow Ukrainians. The Collective is split into three working groups, each representing a key challenge for refugees in Scotland: language and culture, housing, and employment. They discuss the difficulties faced by their communities and come up with potential solutions to these problems. Their recommendations are now being shared with the Scottish Government , local authorities and other relevant bodies supporting the resettlement of Ukrainians in Scotland. We caught up with Oleksandra Novatska, Chair of the Language and Culture Group; Anna Kulish, Chair of the Housing Group; and Alexandr Chernykh, Chair of the Employment Group to find out more about their work and what they hope it will achieve. Why did you volunteer to be part of the Ukrainian Collective? Oleksandra : I want to feel that I am being useful to people. I was very active in social and public life in Ukraine. I worked closely with the city council on culture and art projects and outdoor events to involve citizens, attract tourists and bring a new vision of our city. Alexandr : As a lawyer, I have an understanding of employment law. I wanted to use my management and legal experience to find some solutions for Ukrainians who are having difficulties in the job market. Anna : I am also a lawyer, in real estate and construction. I wanted to use my expertise and my experience as a recipient of housing services when arriving in Scotland to help represent the views of the Ukrainian community. I like working with other people to come up with ideas and look for ways to improve life. What does your role as a group chair involve? Oleksandra : As chair, I’m on the top of a big pyramid of Ukrainians. Lots of highly educated and highly skilled people with a huge background of experience who were leaders in business and culture or played a big part in their community. These skills can really be a benefit here in Scotland. I try to pull all this experience together and deliver it in the right way so we can help other Ukrainians. We think as a group how to improve and bring better services in the area of language and culture. People who are using these services know best what is needed, so we ask for input from the wider community. We then deliver these ideas and solutions to charities, the Scottish Government, and COSLA . Anna : My role as chair is to make sure that our lived experience is shared and our voices are heard. I’m trying to foster an environment where everybody can speak up. I wrap together this information and put it in a more strategic narrative. This is where my skills and experience as a lawyer come up. Alexandr : I’m working to collect information from different parts of Scotland about the situation in the job market and the main problems people looking for work in different fields and professions are facing. I look for examples of what works well in other EU countries and what we can implement from this. I cannot know everything about engineering, sailors, managers, teachers, medics etc. Our members help me to collect this information. We then work together to brainstorm ideas. We are looking from a practical point of view to see if we can find realistic solutions which we can show to the Scottish Government and local authorities. How important is it for Ukrainians to have a say about services that affect their lives here in Scotland? Oleksandra : We are bringing our vision, our backgrounds and our experience here in Scotland to this project. It’s very important that we are directly involved and can share our opinions, visions and thoughts about a process that relates to us. Anna : We are the recipients of these services. We need to have a voice and input in how these services are being provided. Alexandr : It is very important to involve Ukrainians. We can use our experience and connections from Ukraine and other EU countries to help the Scottish and UK governments with advice and creative solutions. What is the best thing about this project? Oleksandra : The idea to be useful to society really drives me. We don’t only want to ask for help. We would like to use our skills, experience and ideas to help the community at the same time. I had a perfect life in Ukraine. I was successful. Everything changed in a moment. I came here and there were big frustrations. Then I found this Collective and I found my people. People with the same ideas, who want to be useful and be part of society. Anna : I imagine the Scottish government has never launched a scheme on this scale before. From the beginning, this was a very unique situation – for there to be the full-scale invasion of one EU country and another EU country to host this many people. There are 25,000 Ukrainians in Scotland. It’s very challenging for everybody, not just the Ukrainians arriving. To be able to help resolve some of those challenges people are facing is the major motivation for members of the Collective. It’s amazing to have an input and represent our community on a strategic level. Every one of us is guided by our willingness to help and our belief that there is nothing for us without us. We are very thankful for the opportunity to raise our voices and use our lived experience to advocate for the interests, not only for the Ukrainian community, but all others in Scotland. Alexandr : When a government wants to set up communications with a refugee community, that is a good sign. What have you found most challenging? Anna: Ukrainian public services operate very differently to British ones. The school system is very different. The higher education system is different. There are very different qualification requirements for professionals in highly skilled roles. A very direct approach, which is very natural in Ukraine, is not very common here. In the context of housing I think those differences trigger breakdowns in communication. Alexandr : The biggest challenge is the strong and complex requirements for different professions. It is not just about getting a job. Many Ukrainians – 70% – have a job. But they are often finding minimum wage jobs. For teachers, accountants, medics, business owners, there are many barriers. If we look at the situation for Ukrainians in other EU countries, they don’t have such complex requirements. People don’t have to wait such a long time to requalify or start their own business. They can get involved in society faster. We try to connect with professional bodies in the UK and understand the rules and requirements for different professions. We collect experience from Ukrainians who have finished getting those requirements and have found interesting jobs. Then we share this information with others and make some recommendations. Oleksandra : It is a very different mentality here in Scotland. We try to learn how the system works so we can act in the correct way. Sometimes we are too direct and expect a response too quick. Every day we learn how to work with different institutions and local authorities to deliver our ideas and proposals. It takes time, but in the end, it works. What difference would you like the Ukrainian Collective to make? Alexandr : I hope my group can help in Scotland and provide a realistic way forward. If it feels that the Scottish Government are valuing our contributions and using some of our ideas. If we see our solutions and suggestions appear in government reports, that will be success. Anna : I never expected the full-scale invasion to last so long. To still be in foreign country doubting whether it’s safe to go home. Wondering whether I need to think about a long-term future somewhere else. We’re now shifting from an emergency response to a long-term response and long-term solutions. The Collective is covering this shift. It is a great blessing for us to have some input and for the Scottish Government to welcome a collaborative approach between two nationalities as we look to the future. This project is a bridge to integration. If it is necessary for the Ukrainian community to settle in Scotland for the long-term, we need to be involved in looking to the future. We have a lot of resources that Scotland can benefit from and we are grateful for the opportunity to share those resources. Oleksandra : People in Scotland have helped me so much and I would like to give something back. I don’t just want to be part of society here. I want to help build a better society where all people can work, study, volunteer and use their skills to benefit others. When we feel part of society, we can make it better for everyone. The Ukrainian Collective are presenting their ideas and recommendations to the Scottish Government and other bodies supporting refugee integration. We hope this valuable input from people with lived experience will help to inform, influence and improve support for people seeking safety.

Scottish Refugee Council,Learning from each other,26-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/learning-from-each-other/,"Community groups supporting New Scots are joining forces to share learning and celebrate success. It was a pleasure to bring together organisations funded by our participation project with The National Lottery Community Fund, to talk about the impact of their work. The learning event, facilitated by Evaluation Support Scotland was an opportunity for groups to evaluate the difference their projects are making to the lives of New Scots. We welcomed representatives from 13 organisations across Scotland who are delivering projects that help people seeking safety feel at home in their communities . They discussed the impact of their projects so far, what they have learned, and how to build better relationships between funders and funded groups. Our Community Development Officer, Phoebe Hendy said: “I found it inspiring to learn more about what the projects have achieved, and a great reminder that small differences really add up.” “Events like this show that evaluation doesn’t have to be scary. It’s about people learning from each other. Bringing funders, community organisations and people with lived experience together in this way is really positive and powerful. The better the relationships between funders and the organisations they’re funding, the better the projects will be.” Funding Officers from The National Lottery Community Fund came along to hear from each of the projects and learn more about the communities they support. The day was a big success. One attendee said: “It was really wonderful meeting representatives from other projects. Learning about what they do, their struggles and how they work to overcome them is really useful.” Steven Marwick, Director of Evaluation Support Scotland said: “Evaluation is not about ticking boxes, it is about learning. It’s rewarding to work with funders that really recognise that. It’s even better to work with a set of fabulous projects, all working together to unpack and share what impact really means in this challenging and important area.” You can read the full report from our learning event here: Supporting New Scots: What difference are we making?

Scottish Refugee Council,Illegal Migration Act: Sign our open letter to the Prime Minister,20-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/illegal-migration-act-sign-our-open-letter-to-the-prime-minister/,"As part of our opposition to the cruel Illegal Migration Act, we have written to Rishi Sunak asking him to to abandon the new legislation. You can read more about the new laws here . We are asking our supporters to show solidarity and sign and share the below open letter. Together, we can show compassion and continue to campaign towards a better future for people seeking protection. The letter is part of a joint campaign with Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Women for Refugee Women and JustRight Scotland. Open letter to the Prime Minister on the Inhumane Migration Law Dear Prime Minister, We write united in our grief, outrage, and shame at the new migration law being passed, allegedly in our name. Your new law is a cruel and inhumane attack on people who are seeking safety on our shores, and who will now be turned away in their hour of need. We all deserve to live safely, and to be supported and protected, whether we are forced to move because our home is no longer safe, or simply for a better life. This compassion is at the heart of our moral duty as a society, as well as our commitment to international law. People move – we always have, and we always will. Community and solidarity are values that bind us all together. We stand in solidarity with everyone targeted by this cruel and immoral legislation. We condemn this Government’s ongoing attacks on migrants and refuse to be complicit in the human rights violations that will result from it. We urge you to abandon this cruel project, and instead protect the rights of people seeking safety. We reject this Act, and say loudly and clearly: this hateful new law is not in our name .

Scottish Refugee Council,Svitlana’s story,19-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/svitlanas-story/,"Svitlana taught English to chemical engineering students at a university in Kyiv. She has a young son, who was 7 when the war began. She vividly describes the experience of fleeing her home at the start of the war. When the war started, it was in the morning. I had had a very rough night, had stayed up late because I was preparing something for my work and went to bed quite late. People started phoning and saying that the war had started. I looked through the window, I live near the highway which goes around the city. That first morning, at 7.30 there was a terrible traffic jam, cars could hardly get out of the city, the jam was just getting bigger and bigger. There was no way to leave the city. At the same time people were going in a direction which was very dangerous, many people were shot on that day. I was just looking from the window, it was raining, and I was just looking and thinking – what can I do in this situation? We don’t have a car so we can’t leave very quickly, we do not have relatives abroad, and if I go somewhere – who will meet us? What will I do? Svitlana and her son lived on the top floor of a nine-storey building, close to the entrance of the city. She had been mentally preparing herself and her son for the war coming, and had some food stored. But it was too dangerous to stay in the flat. Alongside their neighbour, who’s mother was disabled and unable to flee, they sought refuge in an underground crossing for several hours. Then, for the first week of the war, they lived on the third-floor landing of their apartment block. We slept on the stairs, and we could hardly go upstairs to the toilet or to cook something. There was a signal that the bombardment was over, you’d try go to the toilet, then you’d hear the alarm again, turn everything off and go downstairs. You couldn’t take a shower, I remember taking one shower and the alarm going off so I just put on my boots, a nightgown, a winter coat and towel on my head and went back to the landing. Her friends tried to convince her to flee to the countryside, presuming it safer than the city. But she chose not to. As she later found out, the countryside was no safer. Kyiv was quite well protected, but no-one knew how good this protection was. You never knew which place would be hit. Not like in other cities like Kharkiv or Mariupol where everything was destroyed, but in Kyiv only some apartments or buidings were destroyed, and you never knew where this would happen. People who tried to go to the countryside, some were shot in their cars when they tried to get to these places. And later, my friends who told me to go to the country house, they were lucky not to be occupied but they also had to leave their house because rockets were flying over their house 24/7. In the village not far from them, the whole village was destroyed by bombs. Why they wanted to destroy a village, no-one knows. Another village not far from them, Russian troops came and shot all the men with no explanations. They tried to find better shelter in Kyiv, but had no luck, and it was becoming increasingly dangerous. The mayor was telling people to find shelter and prepare for difficult nights ahead. On 2 nd March, Svitlana was convinced to flee the country, by a mother of one of her son’s classmates. The mother came to my house, she was hysterical, saying that she’s lived enough but her child hasn’t, that we have to do something. So we packed in 20 minutes. We couldn’t take suitcases because they wouldn’t be allowed onto the train. We just had to take small rucksacks with necessary things. I had already prepared these but there was some space in them, so I looked around and I didn’t know what else to take. Either you take everything or absolutely nothing! Svitlana left their pet rats with their neighbour, and headed for a checkpoint, where she planned to ask a car to help her flee. This mission was hampered by several more sirens, but they made it eventually. They were able to get into a car with a young journalist from Spain, who was also getting out of the country. He dropped them at a train station, which was difficult because so many people had abandoned their cars near the station. As they arrived, another siren went off, and they had to hide in an underground passage under the station. Svitlana did not have a ticket, and was trying to find an evacuation train, but they were given a ticket by someone else at the station. A young man with his mother, who were walking along the platform, stopped her and asked if she had a ticket. When she said “No”, they sent their spare ticket to Svitlana for free. They helped her and her son to get on the train to Lviv which was less cramped than the evacuation trains. At the very least, they had a seat. When Svitlana and her son arrived at Lviv railway station, it was completely crowded. The departure lounge for mothers and children was full: children were sleeping on the floor, volunteers were giving out sandwiches and drinks, and there was hardly any air to breathe. The underground passage leading to the trains to Poland, which is long and wide, was blocked by people waiting for the next train. Eventually, they were able to board a train to Poland. Only women with children were allowed on the train. Ordinarily a one-hour journey, this train took 18 hours. People could hardly sit, there wasn’t enough places, it was so emotional. They couldn’t take their grandmothers, their husbands, whoever. This train stopped everywhere. It was standing somewhere and there was another train standing opposite it, and that train was full of men. Later we realised this was Ukrainian men who were going from abroad to Ukraine to fight. With absolutely blank faces. This was such an emotional moment. You do not allow yourself to be emotional. You just do what you need to do – you need to feed your child, you need to wash your and your child’s hands, you need to find a place to charge a phone at the station. Half an hour after we left, a rocket hit Kyiv, and some parts of this rocket fell onto the railway station. We were lucky because we had already left. But there were people who were standing on the platform and some part of the railway station was damaged. I don’t know if people were injured, I don’t really remember, but it happened on the same day. Eventually, they arrived in Poland, and were met with volunteers at the railway station. At this particular moment I realised that we are refugees. I didn’t think about it before that, but in this moment I realised how terrible the situation was. We didn’t care who takes us where – looking back, it was a rather dangerous situation, anyone could come and take people anywhere. At that moment we really didn’t care, were exhausted. As a lot of Ukrainians had already arrived in Poland, there wasn’t many places to stay near the station, but I wanted to sleep so badly! Svitlana and her son boarded a bus to another part of Poland, where they stayed with a family who were hosting many Ukrainians. Once she’d slept enough, she booked the cheapest flights to Spain she could find, and they flew to Alicante. In Alicante, the Red Cross put them up in a hotel. But her child couldn’t attend school and she couldn’t get work because of the long process there to get documents. Svitlana started searching for English-speaking countries to move to, where she might understand the rules better, and where her child could get back into school. She looked initially at Ireland, then she came across the Homes for Ukraine scheme in Scotland. They arrived in Scotland on 2 nd May 2022, and are now living in Stevenston, North Ayrshire.

Scottish Refugee Council,Solidarity with people seeking safety as the Illegal Migration bill becomes law,18-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/solidarity-with-people-seeking-safety-as-the-illegal-migration-bill-becomes-law/,"Today Scottish Refugee Council renews our commitment to stand with and alongside people seeking asylum in the UK. In light of the UK’s withdrawal from international responsibility-sharing and the country’s obligations and agreements under international law, we want to reaffirm our continued solidarity and practical support for people seeking safety from the horrors of violent conflict and state sanctioned persecution. We are devastated that this bill has passed. But know we are not alone in this. The Westminster government had to fight hard to get this law passed. We don’t believe it represents the approach the majority of people across the UK want to see. Today we have joined nearly three hundred other organisations in this statement of solidarity: Joint civil society statement on the passage of the Illegal Migration Act, July 2023 As a coalition of 290 organisations representing the human rights, migrants’ rights, refugee and asylum, anti-trafficking, children’s, violence against women and girls, LGBTQI+, disability rights, health, LGBTQI+, housing, racial justice, criminal justice, arts, international development, environment, democracy, pan-equality, faith, access to justice, and other sectors, we condemn the passage of the Illegal Migration Act today, and stand in solidarity with all who will be affected. We all deserve to live safe from harm. But this senselessly cruel Act will have a devastating impact on people’s lives. It turns our country’s back on people seeking safety, blocking them from protection, support, and justice at a time they need it most. In abandoning the UK’s moral and legal obligations, the Act risks breaching multiple international human rights treaties including the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights while shielding the Government from accountability. The UK Government has admitted that it cannot confirm if the Act is compatible with the UK’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act will force people into situations that threaten their lives – whether by placing children in detention or sending people off to countries where their lives might be at grave risk. More-over, the Act attacks the very core of human rights, which is the principle that we all have them regardless of who we are or where we are from. In stripping the most basic rights from people seeking safety and a better life, the Act dismantles human rights protections for all of us. Either all of us have human rights, or none of us do. While the UK Government’s plans will harm those seeking safety the most, this is an attack on all of us and the values we hold dear. The government has rushed through this law despite broad and deep opposition. But our fight is not over. As caring people, we will continue to fight for the right for people to seek safety and a better life without being forced to take dangerous journeys and without being punished for how they enter the UK. We will keep holding those in power to account for upholding the UK’s international obligations. We will strive for an asylum and immigration system that treats everyone with dignity and respect. We will stand in solidarity with and fight alongside everyone who makes the UK their home and build a society that treats everyone with compassion. Join us Author: Pauline D"
Scottish Refugee Council,Illegal Migration bill set to become law,18-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/illegal-migration-bill-set-to-become-law/,"We are devastated this morning at the news that the Illegal Migration bill is now set to become law. The proposed legislation saw opposition from the House of Lords and many members of Parliament. But last night in the final stages of debate, lawmakers at Westminster agreed to pass the proposals which will now become law. The new legislation aims to shut the door on people seeking safety in the UK, by removing the right to claim asylum from those who arrive in the UK independently. In doing so, the law completely undermines the UK’s international obligations, including our agreement to uphold the UN Refugee Convention. Our Head of Asylum and Integration Services, Wafa Shaheen, said: “The Illegal Migration bill is the single most harmful piece of legislation we have seen in the thirty five years Scottish Refugee Council has been supporting people seeking protection. It will cause avoidable, unnecessary harm and hardship to people who need the opposite – support and shelter at a time of great trauma and stress in their lives. “We are horrified that the UK plans to step away from international responsibility-sharing and we are deeply concerned about what this means for people’s rights under the Refugee Convention. We are seeking advice on behalf of the people we support who we will continue to stand with and along side in every way we can.” The UN’s Refugee Agency has already called on the UK government to reverse the legislation, warning of the profound impact it will have on people’s rights and the serious, potentially life-threatening risks it will expose people to. There are also concerns about the how the law will work in practice. Last month the government’s policy of removing people seeking protection to Rwanda was ruled unlawful, raising unanswered questions about how the new laws will actually operate. As we assess the impact of this legislation, we stand in solidarity with everyone affected. We will continue to support people rebuilding their lives in Scotland and we will continue to stand up for the right to seek and secure international protection from violence and persecution.

Scottish Refugee Council,Ronnie’s story,11-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/ronnies-story/,"Ronnie Tagwireyi is one of our volunteers on the Reaching New Scots Fund project and our Refugee Advisory Group. He has been in the asylum system for 8 years, and has recently been invited onto Migration Exchange ’s Advisory Board. He lives in Glasgow. Tell us about the Reaching New Scots Fund. The Reaching New Scots Fund project still blows my mind, and this is a couple of months after we finished it. I remember seeing the advert somewhere and thought – let me go for this! Before that, I wasn’t really doing much. I got picked and was one of the panel. I remember the first day walking in and Phoebe took us through everything and I thought “there’s no way we’re going to manage to do this!” But slowly but surely everything started falling into place. The enormity of the whole thing started to hit me, I walked in like “oh my god we’re onto something here. This hasn’t been done before.” Funding is usually top down, it’s never been done by people who are refugees and asylum seekers themselves. So it was great when the applications went out, and then they came in and there was 100-something applications for a 700K fund. It was an overwhelming response. So that again was very exciting, and then we went on and did the whole process. The process itself – first of all, I’ve got to give credit to Phoebe for the way that she guided us through it. It fell into place so nicely. So much so that I always looked forward to the next session. We showed that this can be done and hopefully it’s the start of a change in how funding works. Hopefully other funders can look at this participatory funding process as something so good from start to finish, that people with lived experience are involved at every stage of the funding process, that would be absolutely fantastic. Thanks too to the National Lottery Community Fund . I’m really glad I was a part of it. Ronnie joined SRC team members Farha and Lisa on a trip to London, to speak at an event held by Migration Exchange, about his work on the Reaching New Scots Fund and our Advisory Group. Ronnie and Farha speaking at Migration Exchange’s Leadership event, 2023 I spoke about what we did and how we went through the entire process, and it was only a week after we’d allocated the funding. It went down so well in the room. There were easily 50-60 people in the room and after I think I had 20 people come to me and take my email down, saying stuff like “oh my god that’s exciting”, “oh my god well done.” “I hope these things inspire people, and enable people in my position who are facing letters of rejection from the Home Office, who don’t have good press, who are dealing with lots of things that make you feel down, to be like, listen, we can do more, let me reach out and try and do something. Cause it’s very easy to just stay at home and mope when you’re in this situation. It was such a fantastic reception I got at London. After the event, Ronnie got speaking to an organiser from Migration Exchange, who encouraged him to apply for their Advisory Board. Migration Exchange, basically what they try to do is connect funders and charity organisations who support refugees and asylum seekers. And they’re trying to get funders to change the way they think and fund what is actually required, aswell as influencing policy and creating more cohesive communities. “So this advisory board, it’s a new concept. They got 9 people who they wanted to be involved from all across the United Kingdom – I made an application and I was taken on. It’s a step up. I’ve got lived experience – I’ve got oodles of lived experience – and I can say that every day but what am I doing with it? This is a chance, it’s a step up to actually put my ideas forward, to try and influence policy, to try and move things in a direction that I feel or my experiences tell me that things should be going in that manner. So Migration Exchange is a good platform for me to do that, and I look forward to the challenge. The Advisory Board asks for 2 years commitment, with around 6 meetings a year. The project has given Ronnie a huge boost and he’s really excited to get started. There’s a skills drain that happens when you’ve been in the asylum system for as long as I have. I’ve been almost 8 years now. What I want to do is influence others in my position to show them that no matter what you can do it. You’re not just an asylum seeker, you’re not just a refugee, you can be someone and your views are worth it. “So that’s where I want to go. I want to lead in that way and be an inspiration for others. Who knows what the future holds but it won’t be for a lack of trying. Good luck Ronnie, we can’t wait to hear all about it!

Scottish Refugee Council,The Illegal Migration Bill: What you need to know,10-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/the-illegal-migration-bill-what-you-need-to-know/,"The UK government’s Illegal Migration Act denies to the right to claim asylum to anyone arriving in the country via an ‘irregular route’ – e.g by small boat or lorry. The government claims this will deter people from making these journeys – but in reality it will result in the detention of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children fleeing oppression and violence. The Bill has been widely condemned by charities, faith groups and community organisations across the country. The Act has now been passed Here are some of the reasons we’re against the Bill and how we plan to oppose it… The Bill is unworkable and inhumane. It breaches human rights laws and takes protections away from the survivors of human trafficking. The Illegal Migration Bill: – Essentially abolishes the right to claim asylum – Strips away all protections from trafficking survivors – Will result in the detention of thousands of people, including pregnant women and children – Breaches UN Refugee Convention laws The impact The Refugee Council has produced a detailed impact assessment on what could happen over the next three years. – Over 190,000 more people could be detained or forced into destitution – 40,000 children could be detained in the UK – Around £9 billion would be spent on accommodation for people seeking protection The Bill is retrospective which means that some asylum laws have changed for anyone who arrived after the 7th March 2023. Find out more here . We’re doing what we can to protect people seeking safety from the worst impacts of the Bill. Alongside Just Right Scotland and the Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland,  we commissioned a legal opinion from Kay Springham KC outlining the impact of Bill in Scotland. Some key points from the expert legal opinion: The Bill ends Scottish Ministers’ powers to support survivors of trafficking in Scotland. Clause 19 of the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to remove unaccompanied children from the supervision of local authority and put them directly into the care of the UK Home Office. There is no precedent for this, and it signals a profound and worrying shift of power to the Home Office to direct the accommodation of children in Scotland. Immigration is a matter reserved to the Westminster Parliament. However, the Bill makes direct intrusions into devolved powers exercised by Scottish Ministers and Scottish public authorities. These are so serious that the Scottish Parliament should have been asked to consider passing a legislative consent motion. We were disappointed to see the Scottish Parliament was not given an opportunity to debate legislative consent. READ the full legal opinion here . Next steps Alongside Amnesty International, Just Right Scotland and the Human Rights Consortium Scotland, we have written to the Presiding Officer asking why MSPs were not given the chance to debate whether the Bill should be given legislative consent. You can read the full letter here . We will continue to campaign against the Bill and we urge Scottish Ministers and Scottish public authorities to take action to challenge and mitigate the impact of the Bill.

Scottish Refugee Council,Illegal Migration Bill sees series of defeats in House of Lords,05-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/illegal-migration-bill-sees-series-of-defeats-in-house-of-lords/,"We are pleased to see international human rights laws have been defended in the House of Lords. Peers have demanded 11 key changes to the Illegal Migration Bill, or, as we call it, the Refugee Ban Bill. The legislation would effectively abolish the right to claim asylum and would close the door to safety that is so desperately needed by people seeking asylum, irrespective of where they fled, be that Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan and other wars, oppressive regimes and human rights abuses. The news comes as the Court of Appeal ruled plans to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda to be unlawful . This would mean that there are no agreements in place with other countries to remove people seeking asylum. The ruling also means that the risk of being removed to Rwanda this year has now greatly decreased. The government has stated its plans to seek permission to appeal the decision at supreme court. Lord Carlile, a former senior barrister, said the government’s appeal to the Supreme Court would not be heard until October at the earliest – after the Refugee Ban Bill is due to have passed through parliament. “We are not in a realistic situation,” he added, calling for the government to withdraw the bill and “start again” if it eventually wins the legal battle. Our CEO Sabir Zazai said: “In Scotland we have an ethical duty to challenge and mitigate the Illegal Migration Bill. “Expert opinion makes it clear that we have a legal obligation under European human rights law to maintain trafficking survivor protection that the Bill otherwise strips away. We must also protect unaccompanied children. “We call on Scottish ministers to lead by taking practical and swift action against this unworkable legislation. We must protect not penalise those who have come here seeking sanctuary or who are trapped in exploitation, and uphold our legal and moral obligations.” Read more about our joint statement opposing the Refugee Ban Bill.

Scottish Refugee Council,‘Inspirational’ Wafa Shaheen awarded honorary degree,03-Jul-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/inspirational-wafa-shaheen-awarded-honorary-degree/,"We are delighted to share the news that Wafa Shaheen, our head of asylum, integration and resettlement, has been awarded an honorary degree. Our colleague was joined today (Monday 3rd July) by the Great British Bake Off’s Prue Leith and 400 students at a graduation ceremony at Queen Margaret University. Wafa has been with the Scottish Refugee Council since 2000. As well as delivering asylum and immigration advice, Wafa has been key in providing strategic insights into the new communities settling in Scotland. She has worked closely on research with the Institute for Global Health and Development at Queen Margaret University, and her insights into the importance of social connections have guided government strategy ever since. She receives her honorary degree in the year QMU’s Institute for Global Health and Development celebrates its 30th anniversary. Wafa Shaheen said: “ I am so happy and tremendously delighted. To receive an honorary doctorate is a great honour, and having been working on Refugee Integration using the model which was developed by two fine academics from QMU makes it very special. “I feel and believe this honour is a recognition of the collective achievements of my colleagues at Scottish Refugee Council who have been working tirelessly in a very challenging political narrative to support people seeking protection in Scotland.” Wafa Shaheen with Prue Leith, chancellor of Queen Margaret University. Image by Malcolm Cochrane Sir Paul Grice, Principal of Queen Margaret University, said: “We are delighted that, today, our students have the opportunity to learn about the life and career of Wafa Shaheem – a strong, compassionate and inspirational woman who has worked tirelessly to support and resettle refugees in Scotland and to help develop policies that recognise and respond to refugees’ resilience and capacities rather than their vulnerabilities. She has been pivotal in the work of QMU’s Institute for Global Health and Development where she has supported research into the importance of social connections. She has been a truly compassionate leader who has helped Scotland build and connect communities and strengthen its capacity for successful multicultural integration. Her achievements align with QMU’s values of social justice and with our aim of producing relevant research and work which makes a positive impact on the world. Her advocacy for compassionate, sustainable, holistic refugee integration could not be more urgent or relevant in today’s world. “We are truly honoured to have such an exceptional individual at graduation, and we are delighted to recognise Wafa’s impressive achievements with an honorary degree.” Author: Gilly Furmage"

Scottish Refugee Council,World Refugee Day: Finding hope away from home,19-Jun-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/world-refugee-day-2023/,"This World Refugee Day, we stand in solidarity with the 110 million people around the world who have been forced from their homes by conflict and persecution. Figures released by UNHCR , the UN Refugee Agency, show that record numbers of people were uprooted from their homes last year. The war against Ukraine, ongoing unrest in countries including Afghanistan, and recent violence in Sudan have all contributed to the massive numbers of displaced people. Around 35.3 million of those forced from their homes are refugees, crossing international borders to escape war and human rights abuses. Many are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of safety. On 14 June, a fishing boat carrying hundreds of men, women and children, sank off the coast of Greece. At least 78 people have died and around 500 more are still missing. This World Refugee Day, we remember all those who have lost their lives and stand alongside those who are grieving, or are separated from their loved ones. What is World Refugee Day? Each year, on 20 June, people around the world come together to celebrate the strength, courage and resilience of people who have been forced to flee their homes to escape conflict or persecution. This year, the theme of World Refugee Day  is Hope Away from Home . We all need hope in our lives, especially right now. Hope brings people together. It inspires us, motivates us and gives us the strength to keep going when times are tough. How you can help Standing in solidarity with people seeking safety is more important than ever.

Scottish Refugee Council,Everyday Hope,19-Jun-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/everyday-hope/,"To mark World Refugee Day, we commissioned Somalian-born photographer, Najma Abukar, to create Everyday Hope, a collection of portraits celebrating New Scots. Everyday Hope is a series of photographic portraits, accompanied by conversations with eight people who have lived experience of forced displacement and who are now settled in Scotland. The project brings together people who have migrated from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Eritrea and Ukraine. Everyday Hope interweaves voices from different generations and backgrounds. Some of the people photographed arrived in Scotland very recently, others settled here some 20 years ago. “People are people, and they come here looking for life. They leave lots behind. They hope that they can build a life here, they hope that they can belong to here.” Abukar shared conversation with participants about their personal life experiences, family, community, war, peace building and survival. Most of all, they talked about hope. Hope for themselves, hope for community, for future generations, collective hope and hope for the everyday. The struggle to hold onto hope in impossible circumstances, but also the very real need to have hope. “Hope for me means survival… Because without that I wouldn’t have survived.” Everyday Hope opens on World Refugee Day (Tuesday 20 June) and runs until Thursday 22 June. The exhibition will be on display at Civic House in Glasgow until Thursday 22 June. The series will also be available to view online at www.cross-borders.org from July. Najma Abukar is a Somalian-born photographer who has resettled in Scotland. Her work documents cultural and gender identities, the African diaspora, and immigrant experiences. Being a first-generation migrant woman of African heritage, her photographic body of work focuses on the strife and resilience of the Other. Najma’s practice is concerned with issues of identity, belonging and (self) representation within the Scottish landscape. Everyday Hope was commissioned by Refugee Festival Scotland and Cross Borders. Refugee Festival Scotland celebrates the contribution refugees and asylum seekers make to Scotland and the welcome offered by local people. The festival runs from 16-25 June with more than 120 events taking place across Scotland which include: campaigning, exhibitions, food, discussions, music, dance, sports, storytelling, children and family activities. Cross Borders is a programme of arts and cultural activism projects led by Scottish Refugee Council. These projects include mentoring, commissions and collaborations with artists, activists and cultural practitioners from refugee and other migrant backgrounds in Scotland.

Scottish Refugee Council,Our HOPE podcast,19-Jun-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/our-hope-podcast/,"Welcome to our new podcast! The HOPE podcast was co-created by a group of radio presenters, podcast hosts, filmmakers and creatives with lived experience of seeking refuge. The aim of the “HOPE ” podcast is to amplify the voices and stories of people with lived experiences of the refugee/ asylum process in Scotland. Through interviews, discussions, and personal narratives, the podcast aims to raise awareness about the challenges faced by new Scots, as well as their resilience and contributions to Scottish society. WATCH: STV News interview with HOPE podcast host Anne, Ibrahim, Ubuntu Women’s Shelter, and our Storytelling Officer Chris Afuakwah. Last year, we were part of the Steering Group for Voices: The Community Story , a project by the Scottish Council on Archives , which collected oral histories of migration from around Scotland. Through this process, we learned audio editing skills. Creating a podcast felt like the obvious next step. We brought together a small group of people to bring the podcast to life. We first met in March 2023 for an initial chat, then worked together to design the structure of the podcast. The group also came up with the name: HOPE, which ties in with the theme of this year’s Refugee Festival Scotland . We then began recording episodes, with thanks to Barclays Eagle Labs for the use of their fantastic podcast suite. Thank you to Anne, Ibrahim, Comfort, Arij, Manar and Fakhriya for your time and efforts in getting this project off the ground. Listen here to the first two episodes of our HOPE podcast .

Scottish Refugee Council,The Meaning of Hope: to be powerful is to be joyful,19-Jun-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/the-meaning-of-hope-to-be-powerful-is-to-be-joyful/,"This year, the theme of Refugee Festival Scotland is the beautiful expectation and desire that is hope. But, what does hope really mean ? How can it confront what we see happening in our refugee communities? By Olivia Sykes, Refugee Festival Scotland volunteer Hope is one of our world’s great unifiers. To me during the festival , I see hope as an aspiration of joy and togetherness. It means that there is so much to be excited about. It means bright colours in banners and artwork. It means delicious smells and food that nourishes. It means cultural beauty, dance, music, and smiles. In refugee spaces and discussions, it can be difficult to find much hope. When confronted with so much doom and gloom – in the media, in books, on television – it can feel paralyzing and difficult to see a path forward. It is vital to recognize and confront the many difficulties and challenges our refugee communities faces. But it is also important to seek out the positives and possibilities. To celebrate successes, relish the good moments. To be hopeful in spite of the challenge. When we as a community choose to only focus on fear and hatred, it can help to reinforce negative attitudes. If we celebrate together, and integrate hope as part of our struggle, it changes the narrative. To have longevity we need to take pauses and build up our communities, which is a key part of taking action. I am not a refugee, but I have experienced hopelessness. I grew up in French Canada and there is a French saying I love, which goes ‘vouloir, c’est pouvoir’. The direct translation is: ‘to want is to be able’ . To desire, to hope, is to mean you can. However, pouvoir has another meaning, which is ‘power’. Even in difficult moments, we can all be powerful, fearless, and celebratory. That is what this festival means in my eyes. This is what I hope for. I will be reflecting on how others perceive this hope, how they interpret it, and return to what it means after we celebrate our coming together. Take some time to be hopeful this festival and strive to find little pieces of joy wherever you are. Not every resistance has to be a heavy one covered in sadness. Joy is a powerful force.

Scottish Refugee Council,UK Government to remove two-tier asylum system,09-Jun-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/uk-government-reveals-plans-to-remove-two-tier-asylum-system/,"We welcome t he news that the UK government has U-turned on the Nationality and Borders Act’s two-tier refugee system. This part of the law sought to deny asylum to people who arrived by so-called irregular routes – such as crossing the Channel on small boats. This would have made life extremely difficult for tens of thousands of people seeking asylum in the UK every year. We are very relieved that this policy has been abandoned. The move means the government will be able to speed up the claims of around 55,000 people who have arrived in the UK since June 2022. In addition, people who arrived from countries with high refugee recognition rates such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Iran and Sudan can be now processed using streamlined questionnaires instead of interviews. The change also means people who arrived by irregular routes will have improved rights, such as the ability to reunite with family members. Welcoming the news, our CEO Sabir Zazai said: “The UK government is quietly admitting that its cruel and discriminatory asylum rules are unworkable. “We the hope that government continues to re-examine their inhumane legislation and we urge them to invest in a fair and humane asylum system rather than the proposed Illegal Migration Bill.” We will be updating the information on our website to reflect these changes.

Scottish Refugee Council,Guardianship Scotland to reach more at-risk children,08-Jun-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/guardianship-scotland-to-reach-more-at-risk-children/,"Our guardianship service for unaccompanied asylum seeking and trafficked children will help more of Scotland’s most vulnerable young people, thanks to Scottish Government funding. In partnership with Aberlour Children’s Charity , we have secured a multi-million-pound contract to deliver Guardianship Scotland , the country’s national child trafficking support service. Our service provides young people, who arrive in Scotland without parents or families, with an Independent Child Trafficking Guardian. Independent Child Trafficking Guardians A guardian is a trusted adult who can speak up on the child’s behalf and support them through the complex and confusing welfare, asylum and legal systems. Our guardians help young people understand what is happening to them and support them to be actively involved in decisions that affect their lives. Guardianship Scotland replaces the Scottish Guardianship Service, which was established by Scottish Refugee Council and Aberlour in 2010. Head of Guardianship Scotland, Catriona MacSween said: “ It is wonderful that we can continue to deliver this excellent service. It is testament to the commitment and fantastic work of our guardians who work closely with Local Authorities and many other organisations to support unaccompanied children and young people. “Asylum-seeking children and victims of trafficking arrive in Scotland alone, confused and scared, having been through unimaginable trauma. We are so pleased that our work has been recognised and we can continue to help them. ” Protecting and supporting children Under Section 11 of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act 2015, all unaccompanied asylum-seeking and trafficked children in Scotland are entitled to be referred to Guardianship Scotland. Local authorities and public bodies in Scotland now have a legal duty to refer children and young people to our service so they can be assigned a guardian. On 2 June, The UN Co mmittee on The Rights of the Child strongly recommended that England and Wales follow Scotland’s example and introduce a statutory guardianship service to ensure that all unaccompanied children in the UK have access to a guardian. Chief Executive of Scottish Refugee Council, Sabir Zazai OBE said: “We’re delighted to be delivering Guardianship Scotland in partnership with Aberlour and look forward to continuing our work together to develop this essential service. “The young people we work with have been through things no child should have to endure. Many have survived human trafficking or fled countries torn apart by war, arriving in Scotland traumatised and alone with no friends or family to take care of them. “We know that with the right support, children can recover from their experiences and go on to thrive. We are committed to ensuring that every unaccompanied child in Scotland gets a dedicated guardian to support them, speak up for them and be by their side as they rebuild their lives.” Scottish Government Minister for Children and Young People, Natalie Don, visited Guardianship Scotland on 7 June to officially launch the service. She meet with guardians and heard from young people we support about some of the issues they face She said: “It is a privilege to help launch this new guardianship service, which is another example of how Scotland is offering a welcoming environment to people arriving in our country. “Arriving alone can have a devastating and lasting impact on the lives of children and young people – so it is vitally important for them to be given access to the care and support they need to help them adjust to their new life here. “I look forward to working with the Scottish Refugee Council and Aberlour to ensure that we are getting it right for all of the young people in need of our support.” Growing demand Guardianship Scotland is currently supporting 730 children and demand for the service has grown rapidly in recent years. In 2021, 152 children were referred to the service. In 2022, that number rose to 343, an increase of more than 120%. Since January of this year, more than 140 children have been referred to our guardianship service. Chief Executive of Aberlour Children’s Charity, SallyAnn Kelly OBE said: “We are thrilled to have been awarded the contract to run Guardianship Scotland. We have worked alongside the Scottish Government, Home Office, and Local Authorities over the past 12 years to ensure every unaccompanied asylum-seeking or trafficked child arriving in Scotland has the support of a guardian. “Recently, we have seen a significant rise in the numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and there is an even greater need for the service. We are delighted to build on this successful partnership with Scottish Refugee Council and provide support to more unaccompanied children.” In addition to the core statutory service, Guardianship Scotland offers: Ukraine Children and Host Family Service Wellbeing Project – providing holistic mental health support Befriending Service – supporting social and community integration Participation programme – supporting young people to be heard, gain skills and have fun Find out more about Guardianship Scotland Read our interview with Catriona MacSween, Head of Guardianship Scotland to find out more about the difference having a trusted, independent guardian makes to children’s lives.

Scottish Refugee Council,Research reveals link between government’s anti-migrant rhetoric and far-right activity,24-May-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/research-reveals-link-between-governments-anti-migrant-rhetoric-and-far-right-activity/,"We have written to Home Secretary Suella Braverman in the wake of findings from HOPE not Hate which show a link between the government’s anti-migrant rhetoric and far-right activity. The research shows that: Far-right engagement around migration is increasing as the government’s Refugee Ban Bill campaign continues. HOPE not Hate found a 149% increase in messages on anti-migrant far-right channels on Telegram from 2021 to the first months of 2023 Far-right activity online spikes around key government announcements . For example, in May 2022, an announcement by Boris Johnson that 50 asylum seekers had been told they would be sent to Rwanda led to a 72% increase in messages about migration in far-right groups on Telegram. Far-right engagement on migration increases when media coverage increases . Articles in The Daily Mail, The Daily Express, The Sun and local media are shared in far-right anti-migrant discussions on Telegram, often alongside extreme racist language. Researchers also highlighted that the home secretary’s anti-migrant rhetoric has been frequently repeated in far-right messaging. Last October Suella Braverman claimed the south coast of England was being ‘invaded’ by people seeking asylum, which then led to a 52% rise in the use of word ‘invasion’ on Telegram. Our joint letter, signed along with HOPE not Hate, Refugee Council and Freedom from Torture, among others, states: “New research from HOPE not hate provides clear evidence that hostile government and media rhetoric on migration is escalating far-right anti-migrant activity. “We are calling for an end to the use of inflammatory language by elected politicians that scapegoats individuals seeking asylum as targets for hate. “We are concerned that if those in positions of power in politics and the media do not immediately change course people seeking sanctuary and their communities will be at greater threat of physical violence.” Read the full report from HOPE not hate.

Scottish Refugee Council,Sanctuary for people from Sudan,10-May-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/sanctuary-for-people-from-sudan/,"Violent unrest in Sudan is rapidly leading to a humanitarian emergency, with hundreds of thousands of people facing food, water and fuel shortages as well as being at direct risk of harm from violent clashes in and around the country’s capital. Find out more about support and information for people affected by the crisis in Sudan. The UN’s refugee agency expects around 800,000 people will be forcibly uprooted from their homes as they attempt to escape the conflict. We are calling on authorities in the UK  to provide safety to people fleeing for their lives, and to play a part in sharing global responsibility to provide protection to people whose lives are at risk. We ask the UK government to do three things: Provide immediate sanctuary (refugee status) to people from Sudan who are currently in the UK’s asylum system and waiting for a decision on their claim. There is no reason for the Home Office to delay these decisions. Sudan is a high refugee recognition country and it is clearly currently not a safe place to be returned to. Work with the UN Refugee Agency to proactively apply its existing UK Resettlement Scheme to people in the affected area. There is much learning from the Ukraine, Afghan and Syrian schemes to allow for a rapid delivery of such a scheme. Lift (a) unnecessary restrictions on family reunion rules to allow families in the UK with members in Sudan to be swiftly reunited and (b) as they did with Ukraine refugees, divert and front-load resources into accelerating family reunion decisions to get those in the affected area to safety in the UK. We call on the Scottish government to support us in this and for the Scottish government to provide the resources needed for charities, public law firms and other experts to deliver speedy, effective reunion for families in Scotland with members in Sudan. The people of Sudan, including our friends and colleagues who are settled here in Scotland and those still desperately waiting for refugee status, are in our thoughts as the violence continues.

Scottish Refugee Council,The House of Lords must reject ‘dehumanising and immoral’ Illegal Migration Bill,26-Apr-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/we-urge-the-government-to-reject-refugee-ban-bill/,"Over 100 Scottish organisations urge the House of Lords to reject the Illegal Migration Bill. The inhumane and unworkable Illegal Migration Bill has today (10 May 2023) moved to Second Reading in the House of Lords. This harmful legislation seeks to effectively abolish asylum rights and protections. The Bill was passed in the House of Commons despite opposition from the SNP, Labour and others, as well as mass protests across UK and Scotland. Its Second Reading in the Lords gives peers the chance to debate the key principles and main purpose of this legislation, and to raise major concerns about changes. As part of a coalition of over 100 organisations across Scotland, we are calling on the House of Lords to reject this Bill in its entirety. Rather than combating organised crime and traffickers, this legislation is a major threat to the fight against human trafficking and modern slavery. Not only has the UK Government failed to consult organisations across the sector about the content of the Bill, it contains flawed amendments relating to Scottish devolved competencies, which challenge our local authorities’ locus and ability to protect unaccompanied refugee and trafficked children; to give safety to exploitation survivors and to safeguard our Scottish Parliament’s devolved competences. The human consequences of the Bill will be devastating to people who need safety and will lead to greater discrimination, given how the language, tone and concept of ‘illegal’ has been racialised. A recent report from the Helen Bamber Foundation shows that last year over 850 children were wrongly ‘assessed’ by the Home Office to be adults based on their appearance – this exposes the unequal treatment and outcomes for individuals in the migration system. This legislation will create even greater inequalities in our society and in our communities, by granting the Home Office the power to remove children from an existing care system in Scotland, taking them into a callous and neglectful Home Office regime instead. The Home Secretary’s record on caring for children has already resulted in the disappearance of over 200 children , with police and other experts warning that many may have fallen prey to serious organised crime networks. Statistics show that one in five people arriving in small boats are children – we fear that this Bill will increase their vulnerability, particularly those who are alone, including to exploitation by organised crime. This legislation perversely embeds inequalities even deeper into our own society and communities, in a racialised and segregating system that is rooted in the punishment of some of the most vulnerable people in the world. We should protect not punish refugees and trafficking survivors. Emma Hutton, CEO of JustRight Scotland, said: “This #RefugeeBanBill will put survivors of human trafficking and unaccompanied children at risk of even greater harm, when we should be providing them with support and securing their access to justice. It is an attack on some of the most basic human rights such as the right to seek refugee protection and the right to liberty and security. “We believe that safe, dignified and legal routes are possible – we have seen that with programmes for refugees from Ukraine and Hong Kong. There is a diverse movement of resistance against this legislation and we call on the Lords to reject this Bill today.” Sabir Zazai, Chief Executive of Scottish Refugee Council, said: “ We are profoundly concerned about the impact of the proposed Illegal Migration Bill. “We believe the Bill will not deter desperate people from seeking safety but will instead result in people who have experienced trauma being imprisoned in disused army barracks, barges and detention centres. “While the UK Government uses hostile language to scapegoat refugees and people seeking asylum, the real issue is their failure to invest in a well- functioning, responsive asylum system. “We welcome the Scottish Parliament’s majority rejection of the bill’s proposals and call on the parliament and the Scottish Government to use their full powers to protect the people most at risk of the harm. “As the bill progresses through Westminster, we call on the UK government to scrap the legislation and instead focus on delivering a fair and efficient asylum system, and providing safe and legal routes for those who need them. “This isn’t about politics, or ‘small boats’; it’s about saving lives.” Along with many of our coalition, we call for the Lords to vote against the #RefugeeBanBill.

Scottish Refugee Council,Supporting New Scots Fund announces funding,12-Apr-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/supporting-new-scots-fund-announces-funding/,"The Supporting New Scots Fund strives to make it easier for refugees across Scotland to learn English and find work. The initiative aims to help refugees and people seeking asylum become part of their communities and reduce their risk of poverty. Funding has been awarded to projects which deliver on two key areas: English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Employability. Our head of policy and communications Gary Christie said: “We were overwhelmed with the high quality of submissions. The incredible standard we’ve seen further highlights the need for more funding for ESOL and employability projects across Scotland.” The ESOL projects receiving funding are: Community Infosource, East Ayrshire Council, East Lothian Works, Govan Community Project, Renfrewshire Council Adult and Family Learning Service, Cassiltoun Housing Association, Freedom from Torture, Barnardos, CSREC and FOSS.

Scottish Refugee Council,Army barracks and floating barges are not the solution to a problem of the government’s own making,05-Apr-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/army-barracks-and-floating-barges-are-not-the-solution-to-a-problem-of-the-governments-own-making/,"Our response to the UK’s plans to house people in disused army accommodation and floating barges Portacabins, army barracks and floating barges have all been proposed by the UK government as accommodation options for people currently stuck in hotel rooms across the country. The truth is, none of these wildly inappropriate proposals will solve the issues with accommodating people seeking asylum. The reality the government refuses to accept is that it has failed to invest in delivering a well-functioning, fair and efficient asylum system. That is what has led to today’s situation where over 170,000 people are stuck in limbo in hotel rooms living day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existences across the country. With timely, effective decision-making, the people stuck in hotel rooms could be moving on with their lives. When people receive a positive decision on their claim for protection, they no longer require ‘asylum accommodation’. With refugee status, people can move into their own homes, earn a living and have a better chance of recovering from their experiences. But the government refuses to run a well-functioning protection system. Instead, we are seeing the system being run into the ground. Decisions on people’s claims drag on for months and years. Resources are poured into the profits of private accommodation providers rather than local authorities and communities. Asylum is politicised and more and more headline-grabbing policies are announced every week. We need a system that is fair, effective and efficient. That is the only thing that will reduce this ‘backlog’ of people currently in the system. Hotel rooms, boats, barges, army barracks are completely inappropriate for people who are fleeing violence and human rights abuses and who are here seeking safety after life-threatening journeys. These types of large-scale, institutional accommodation arrangements are also inappropriate and problematic for local communities. None of these – barges, army barrack, portacabins – are the solution. They will not tackle the root cause which is poor management of the system itself.

Scottish Refugee Council,Important information – changes to UK asylum rules,30-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/important-information-changes-to-uk-asylum-rules/,"Important information for anyone arriving in the UK on or after 7 March 2023 The rules around claiming asylum are changing. If you entered the UK on or after 7 March 2023 your case will be treated differently. This is because the UK Government plans to pass a law that will change the way asylum claims are treated. This is not yet law but we expect it will be very soon. Right now, the most important thing you can do if you entered the UK on or after 7 March 2023, is seek legal advice as soon as possible. A lawyer will give you advice about what to do next and answer your questions about the law changes. If you receive a letter from the Home Office, take that to your lawyer who will explain what to do next. It’s really important to phone a lawyer and seek legal advice as soon as you arrive. You have the right to ask for free legal advice. Here is a list of solicitors in Glasgow who work on immigration and asylum. Here is a list of solicitors in Edinburgh Here is more info about how to access legal advice If you are not in the Glasgow / Edinburgh areas or have problems contacting the lawyers listed above, phone our helpline 0808 1967 274 If you know someone who entered the UK on or after 7 March 2023, please share this information with them.

Scottish Refugee Council,Funding boost for New Scot communities,29-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/funding-boost-for-new-scot-communities/,"We’re delighted to announce that 35 communities have received a funding boost from our refugee-led Reaching New Scots Fund. More than £800,000 has been awarded to projects across Scotland that help New Scots feel at home in their communities. Making Funding fairer and more accessible The Reaching New Scots Fund was managed and co-designed by Scottish Refugee Council and volunteers from refugee backgrounds, in partnership with The National Lottery Community Fund . This new approach aims to make it easier for refugee-led community groups, that might otherwise miss out on funding opportunities, to successfully apply for grants. Applications were assessed by a panel of staff from The National Lottery Community Fund and 11 volunteers with lived experience of the refugee and asylum system. Supporting New Scot communities All 35 projects awarded funding are either run by refugee communities, or provide support for people seeking safety in Scotland. Successful projects include: ScrapAntics ScrapAntics in Dundee will fund a series of creative and social activities for recently arrived refugees. The programme will include a ‘Conversation Cafe’, cookery classes, and creating a mural and garden of sanctuary. Sunny Cycles Glasgow-based Sunny Cycles will run bike lessons, skills sessions and group bike rides for New Scots and their families. The project will help adults and children gain greater knowledge of the Glasgow cycle network, so they can travel round the city safely. Inspiring Young Voices In the Highlands, Inspiring Young Voices will create a peer support group to improve the emotional and social wellbeing of young people from refugee backgrounds. The project will be shaped and owned by New Scots aged between 10-25 years of age. Jambo! Radio Renfrewshire-based Jambo! Radio will offer training in radio presenting, production and broadcasting skills. The 12-month project will offer hands on training and support for New Scots interested in pursuing a career in broadcast media. Amma Birth Companions Amma Birth Companions will use the funding to support refugee women in some of Glasgow’s most marginalised communities. Their highly skilled staff deliver specialist, trauma-informed perinatal, birth and postnatal services. For the Love of a Child Fife-based For the Love of a Child , will offer dramatherapy sessions for children who have arrived in Scotland from Ukraine. Over the next 12 months, the project will support 56 5-11-year-olds who are experiencing trauma and loss. Afroscots United FC Afroscots United FC helps New Scots to keep fit and make friends through their shared love of the beautiful game. Their project aims to tackle loneliness and isolation. They will hold walk and talk sessions and host cultural celebrations on significant dates like Burns Night, Easter and Eid. Meet the Reaching New Scots Fund volunteers We asked some of our volunteers how they felt about being part of the Reaching New Scots Fund. Fatou: “ This experience gives me hope. It’s so important to include New Scots. People with lived experience know about problems, like language barriers. We know how funding can benefit communities. I’m very happy to have been involved in this funding because it’s going to change a lot of people’s lives.” Solomon: “I love it so much! I didn’t know anything about funding when I started this process. I had been applying for funding and missing out and I didn’t know why. Now I know how decisions are made and what funders are looking for. It has enlightened me.” Adebolaji: “We have good lived experience so we really know the needs of other people who are passing through this journey.” Eissa: “This project empowered me with knowledge and skills about the application process, what makes a good project, and how to make funding decisions. I’ve gained a lot of knowledge and I also shared information and knowledge from my lived experience. I want to start an organisation to help people affected by climate migration. I’ll use all the knowledge and experience I’ve gained to make it a success.” Shared learning The Reaching New Scots Fund puts refugee communities at the heart of funding decisions. Our panel of refugee volunteers have gained valuable experience of working alongside an established funder. And The National Lottery Community Fund has gained greater insight into the challenges faced by small refugee-led organisations. Our CEO, Sabir Zazai said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with The National Lottery Community Fund to put people with lived experience at the heart of the funding process. “There can be so many barriers that prevent refugee communities from successfully applying for funding. Therefore, it’s great to see our refugee-led panel using their knowledge and experience to help change that. “People from refugee backgrounds have so many skills and insights to offer. The Reaching New Scots Fund is a really great example of how we can harness these skills for the benefit of communities across Scotland.” Neil Ritch, Scotland Director, The National Lottery Community Fund said: “It was a real pleasure to spend time with our partners at Scottish Refugee Council as part of the final round of decision making on the Reaching New Scots Fund. “Pooling our grant making skills and knowledge with the expertise of our Scottish Refugee Council colleagues has been a really positive experience. We’ve all learned a lot. I was really heartened to see the positive relationships forged and hugely encouraged to hear multiple stories of mutual learning. “I’m hugely grateful to the volunteers who have been so generous with their knowledge, expertise and time and I’m excited to see the funded projects deliver in communities all over Scotland.” A new approach to funding The Reaching New Scots Fund is the second phase in a collaborative approach to funding made possible thanks to £1.5 million raised by National Lottery players for grassroots groups and organisations. We hope this project will help shape future funding opportunities, making it easier for groups supporting New Scots to apply and successfully secure grants. Author: Rachel Lamb Communities"

Scottish Refugee Council,Stories from Afghanistan in Perth,27-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/stories-from-afghanistan-in-perth/,"Perth Amnesty International organised a celebration for local Afghan women to mark International Women’s Day in collaboration with Scottish Refugee Council. The event took place on Saturday March 4 th at the AK Bell Library . Afghan women living locally and in other parts of Scotland shared their stories and informed those present, including representatives from women’s organisations in Perth, about the impact of the Taliban regime on the lives of women and girls. As one participant said,” Watching the news is not the same as hearing a personal account”. Amnesty International have been campaigning since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 for the rights of women and girls, which have been severely restricted, to be restored.  Educational opportunities beyond primary school are now denied and access to travel, work, healthcare and involvement in public life is almost non-existent.  AI is asking the international community to advocate for the rights of all Afghans, including women and girls, for fundamental rights including the right to life, freedom of expression, freedom of association, access to education, employment, political participation and freedom of movement. Traditional dress on display during the event. Amanda Brown, Chair of Perth Amnesty Group: ‘While supporting the Afghan women who have settled in Perth and hearing their stories we also want to draw attention to the many women living in Afghanistan who are facing discrimination, exclusion, poverty and threats of violence on a daily basis.’ One of the Afghan women said she was so pleased that the event had happened so that women in Afghanistan will not be forgotten.

Scottish Refugee Council,Scotland Rejects the Refugee Ban Bill,23-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/scotland-rejects-the-refugee-ban-bill/,"We’ve joined forces with 100 organisations across Scotland to reject the UK government’s Refugee Ban Bill. We are calling for Home Secretary Suella Braverman to scrap her cruel Illegal Migration Bill . The UN Refugee Agency has called this bill an ‘asylum ban’. We agree. That’s why we’re calling it the Refugee Ban Bill. You can read our joint statement, written in partnership with JustRight Scotland, in full here. This bill will not stop desperate people from seeking safety. But it will cost lives. If Suella Braverman really wanted to stop people from risking their lives on dangerous channel crossings, she would provide safe routes for people seeking safety. Instead, she is trying to force through legislation that will prevent survivors of trafficking, torture, war and persecution from claiming refugee protection. This bill slams the door on people whose lives are in danger because of their religious beliefs, political views, ethnicity, gender or sexuality. It will remove the fundamental human right to claim asylum from people arriving in the UK. And it goes against Scottish laws set up to protect survivors of trafficking and exploitation. What we’re doing to oppose the Refugee Ban Bill We’re calling for all MPs, especially those representing constituents in Scotland, to work together to reject this bill in its entirety We also call on the Scottish Government and all MSPs in the Scottish Parliament to: Reject this Bill in its entirety Bring a motion for debate to withhold legislative consent for the Bill Outline a plan to protect refugees and trafficking survivors Reaffirm Scotland’s commitment to human rights including compliance with the Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child What you can do to help stop the Refugee Ban Bill If you are an organisation 1.

Scottish Refugee Council,Stop the Refugee Ban Bill,13-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/stop-the-refugee-ban-bill/,"We’re gutted that the UK Government’s cruel new Illegal Migration Bill has passed it’s second reading in the House of Commons. The Refugee Ban Bill was passed by 320 yes votes to 250 no votes at its second reading on Monday 13 March. It will now move to committee stage where each part of the legislation and any proposed amendments will be discussed. The Bill is, in reality, a Refugee Ban. If passed, it will not only strip people of their right to seek asylum in the UK, but also punish them for how they arrive here. This Bill will sweep away decades of refugee protection, which was enshrined in the Refugee Convention following the atrocities of the Holocaust. We would like to thank all 250 MPs who stood up for refugee rights and human rights by voting against these horrendous proposals. You can find a full list of how MPs voted here . Dehumanising legislation The UK Government claims that it wants people to apply for asylum using “safe, legal routes”, but these routes do not exist. As it stands, people must be on UK soil to claim asylum. This Bill will criminalise people indiscriminately for arriving here on small boats or in the back of trucks, without creating any safe routes to allow people to avoid these dangerous journeys. This legislation will not help stop people from needing to seek safety. But it will further dehumanise people who have fled their homes, and legally remove our obligations to protect them. Increase in use of detention This Bill could leave thousands of people in limbo, consigned to extreme poverty or left isolated in detention centres. We will see more detention centres, the detention of children and families, and forced removals. While people in need of safety suffer needlessly, the private companies running detention centres will profit hugely. Removal of rights for trafficking survivors The Bill will remove protections for survivors of trafficking and slavery, including rights enshrined in Scottish legislation. We urge Scottish ministers to protect our anti-trafficking laws and survivors rights. Removing the rights of trafficking survivors plays into the hands of organised crime and exploitation. Removal of rights for unaccompanied children Unaccompanied children will also face the full strength of this Bill. They too will be unable to claim asylum if they arrive irregularly and will be far less likely to be identified as trafficking survivors. The bill will also give the Home Office the power to exert greater or full legal control over unaccompanied children, despite 200 children recently going missing under Home Office care. We fear that this bill will only increase the vulnerability of unaccompanied young people, and again, play into the hands of organised crime and exploitation. We demand an alternative. This is a dangerous, dehumanising and morally repugnant Bill. Read the full briefing we prepared ahead of the second reading . We demand a compassionate alternative. We urge everyone to reject the Refugee Ban Bill, and we join our colleagues at Together With Refugees to call for an asylum system which: Protects refugees and defends the fundamental human right to asylum. Stands up for the UN Refugee Convention and the UK’s proud history as a founding signatory. Establishes safe routes for people to seek asylum in the UK. Gives people seeking asylum a fair hearing. Stand up for refugee rights You can show solidarity with people seeking safety by joining the Resist Racism march this Saturday. Thousands of people will also be gathering in Glasgow, London and Cardiff to mark UN Anti-Racism Day. Bring your friends, family and a colourful banner.

Scottish Refugee Council,Our response to the Home Office’s anti-refugee legislation,07-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/our-response-to-the-home-offices-anti-refugee-legislation/,"We are deeply concerned about the Home Office’s proposal to block asylum applications from people who have arrived in the UK via irregular routes. The bill is a further attack on the fundamental human right to seek asylum. These proposals would strip people fleeing war and persecution of their right to seek safety in the UK, punishing them for the act of seeking protection. This is not ‘pushing the boundaries of international law’. It is a blatant disregard of the Refugee Convention which expressly prohibits penalising people for crossing a border. Our CEO Sabir Zazai said: “The bill is a further attack on the right to seek asylum. The proposals would leave people fleeing violent and oppressive regimes with no legal way to claim asylum. “But seeking asylum is a human right, and the UK has made international agreements to uphold that right. “Seeking asylum is a human right.” “We can’t see how the government will be able to make these proposals work. “Instead of grabbing headlines with a cruel and unworkable bill, the UK government should focus on building a compassionate, fair and workable asylum system. One which prioritises safe routes to reach the UK, orderly and effective asylum processing and grown-up discussions with the European Union.” Two out of three people who arrive by small boat are granted asylum, including 48% who come from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Eritrea and Sudan where nearly all would be granted asylum. The bill would result in tens of thousands– including vulnerable people and children – being kept in mass detention. And at risk of serious harm. Yet again the Home Office is proposing a bill with the primary intention to deter people seeking protection, but people will continue to come to the UK because of the often violent and harrowing situations they are escaping from. The UK has already one of the strictest asylum systems in Europe. Unlike for refugees from Ukraine, there are very few safe routes for refugees to come to the UK for protection. The bill would mean turning our backs on desperate people that deserve our help. Our neighbours in France, Germany and Spain take many more applications from refugees than the UK, with Germany taking more than three times the number. We call on the government to focus on creating a compassionate, fair and workable system which prioritises safe routes to get here, orderly and effective asylum processing, and a comprehensive UK strategy of welcome at national and local level.

The 10-page document will be sent to over 12,000 people seeking asylum from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen. More than 160,000 people seeking asylum are awaiting initial decisions on their applications, with some living in limbo for years. The Home Office has said the questionnaire is part of efforts to ‘clear the backlog.’ The document must be filled in in 20 working days, and in English. If the questionnaire is not filled out within the timeframe the asylum application may be withdrawn . Our joint letter, addressed to Suella Braverman, states: “This proposed plan of withdrawing claims will only give the appearance of reducing the backlog, whilst in fact adding to the backlog of fresh asylum claims being made. We urge the government to rethink its plan and to remedy it.” Matilda Bryce, asylum policy and campaigns manager at the charity Freedom from Torture, said: “The questionnaire in its current form risks exacerbating the asylum backlog while jeopardising the asylum claims of individuals unable to complete the form before the arbitrary deadline.” Suggested amendments to the questionnaire include: Simplifying the document Providing translations in relevant languages Creating a user-friendly guide for completion of the questionnaire Providing an extension for all unrepresented individuals Read the full letter here .

Scottish Refugee Council,Supporting New Scots Fund opens for tenders,06-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/supporting_new_scots/,"We’ve launched a Supporting New Scots Fund to make it easier for refugees across Scotland to learn English and find work. The initiative aims to help refugees and people seeking asylum feel more at home in their new communities and reduce their risk of poverty. The Supporting New Scots Fund is open to open to organisations that support refugee integration, including Local Authorities, the Third Sector and other bodies working with people seeking safety. A total of £500,000 is available to fund projects which deliver on two key areas: English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Employability. Tenders must be submitted by 11.59pm on Sunday, 26 March. Find out more about the Supporting New Scots Fund and how to apply for funding here. The New Scots Integration Delivery Project This fund is part of a wider New Scots Refugee Integration Delivery Project led by the Scottish Government in partnership with Scottish Refugee Council, COSLA, and the UNESCO Chair for Refugee Integration through Languages and the Arts at the University of Glasgow. The Scottish Government recently announced that additional funding had been secured from the European Union Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) to support work to integrate refugees across Scotland. Sabir Zazi, CEO of  Scottish Refugee Council, said: “Successful, well integrated communities need support, both for the individuals seeking safety in Scotland and the local areas receiving them. We’re particularly pleased to see funding in place to boost English language support and to help people back into employment. These are two areas that are crucial to integration, both for the individuals and families affected and the communities receiving them.” £1.6 million will focus on the development of an updated New Scots Refugee Integration Strategy ensuring people seeking safety are supported to make their new communities their home. Other projects that have received funding include: The Supporting New Scots Fund, which will provide £500,000 in targeted funding for ESOL and Employability Small grants to encourage wide-scale public engagement across Scotland for the refreshed New Scots Refugee Integration Strategy by enabling organisations to host engagement events for existing and recently arrived New Scots The extension of University of Glasgow’s international research into New Scots integration for Afghan and Ukrainian Nationals, focussing on efforts made by the Scottish Government, local authorities and the third sector to support integration, Refugee Festival Scotland – a focal point and celebration of all New Scots in Scotland. This will include providing small grants to organisations to enable them to host events as part of the Festival Angus Robertson, The Scottish Government’s External Affairs Secretary, said: “Scotland has a long history of welcoming people of all nationalities and faiths, including those seeking refuge from war and persecution. While continuing to support all refugees and people seeking asylum, in recent years we have seen two large scale resettlement efforts from Afghanistan and Ukraine, with over 20,000 displaced people from Ukraine alone arriving in Scotland since February 2022 and we have had to move quickly to get people the support they need to settle into their new communities. “The Scottish Government and our New Scots partners are committed to supporting the integration of refugees and people seeking asylum into our communities and providing the safety and security they need as they begin to rebuild their lives. Our compassionate approach to support refugees and people seeking asylum living in Scotland is clear and this vital funding will ensure work can continue to refresh the New Scots strategy to take account of the significant changes in recent years and ensure any key learning is reflected.” Find out more about the Supporting New Scots Fund and how to submit a tender here.

Scottish Refugee Council,Our visit to the Bield’s creative arts residency,06-Mar-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/our-visit-to-the-bields-creative-arts-residency/,"Peace… Calm…Relief… …just some of the words used by participants to describe their experience at the New Scots Creative Arts Residency, held by the Bield at Blackruthven . Funded by the Reaching New Scots Fund , with thanks to the National Lottery Community Fund , this fully-funded residency is for artists with lived experience of seeking refuge in Scotland. 10 artists from Ukraine, Syria and Iran, based across Scotland, are taking part. We visit on the penultimate day of the residency in February 2023. Located just outside of Perth, the first impression of the Bield is of a place of tranquillity. This is confirmed stepping into the art workshop – music playing gently, a log-burning stove flickering, the scratching of charcoal or pastels, the scraping of seats as artists get up to replenish their paint pots from the plentiful store cupboard. Everyone is working on their own project, testing out some new techniques, developing ideas. One artist tells us that in all the time she’s spent in Scotland, she’s never had time like this for herself. Between work and studying and navigating rebuilding her life, it’s hard to find time to be creative. But here, she has felt relief, and is loving having a full cupboard of art materials to play around with. All artists will also receive £400 each to spend on art materials, to enable them to continue to develop their work after the residency. They will then be back here in October, leading up to an exhibition of their work. Finding joy… We leave the artists working on their projects and pop across the courtyard to the lounge, where facilitators Karen and Steve are leading a workshop on Playback Theatre. The group are working towards a performance later this evening, sharing stories and improvising together. In real-time you get to see a group of people interpreting your story, and can provide feedback on whether they captured it well. It’s good fun, with loads of positive energy and laughter, and everyone is particularly excited by a horse called Molly – but its purpose runs even deeper than that. Finding common ground, building community, celebrating human experience, finding joy, healing. Another artist, from Ukraine, tells us how much it means to her to have this space to be creative and remember who she is. With so much going on, it’s nice to reconnect with this side of herself too, which has been neglected while she deals with fleeing her home, the ongoing invasion, fears for family and friends. Reality is never far away. You can see it in the paintings, hear it in the stories, it comes up in conversations. But just for a few days, all that external noise is dulled. The group get a chance to escape into the creative sides of their minds, surrounded by serene countryside, friendly staff “that are like family”, and a store cupboard full of art supplies. Watch this space for news about their exhibition in October. We look forward to returning! Find out more about the Reaching New Scots Fund . Learn more about our work with communities .

Scottish Refugee Council,Our CEO Sabir Zazai reflects on the anniversary of the war against Ukraine,24-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/our-ceo-sabir-zazai-reflects-on-the-anniversary-of-the-war-against-ukraine/,"This time last year we watched in shock as Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine. It came just six months after the Taliban takeover Afghanistan and my home country’s subsequent collapse into violent unrest. In a world of seemingly constant crisis and conflict, the arrival of all-out war in Europe, almost on our doorstep, was deeply destabilizing and upsetting. Overnight, we watched hundreds of thousands of people try to escape the violence in Ukraine. We called for humanitarian corridors to allow people to seek safety in neighbouring countries. Today, more than eight million people have fled Ukraine . Eight million people with hopes, dreams, jobs, families, worries, normal everyday lives that have been turned upside down and, in some cases, ripped apart. The war against Ukraine reminds us how quickly and devastatingly our lives can change. How, from one day to the next, we may find ourselves up against closed borders and hostile immigration policies. How rapidly we may need to turn to other countries, other governments, for protection. After much campaigning, the UK government issued entry visas to people fleeing Ukraine and launched the community sponsorship scheme, which provides people from Ukraine with temporary housing in private homes with UK families. The scheme worried us. We believe governments should take responsibility for looking after people seeking international protection, not private citizens, who can’t guarantee that their own circumstances won’t change, and that they will be able to provide consistently for the new arrivals. There have been many ups and downs with this sponsorship scheme over the last twelve months, but the number of ordinary people across Scotland and the UK who put themselves forward as hosts, has been incredibly positive and inspiring. Equally inspiring is the strength and resilience of the people from Ukraine that we’ve been lucky to get to know this year. Like many people in Scotland, we have new Ukrainian colleagues and friends, our children have new classmates speaking Ukrainian in school and our neighbourhoods have welcomed new markets, bakeries and other businesses. We have learnt a lot this year but it has not been straightforward and it has not been easy. We continue to stand with the people of Ukraine and hope for an end to the war and for peace to return to the country as soon as possible. We hope that the response to the war against Ukraine, both in terms of the UK and Scottish governments’ response, as well as the willingness of ordinary people to welcome and provide a safe home for others, can be replicated for people in need of protection from other parts of the world.

Scottish Refugee Council,From Ukraine to Scotland: Olga and Oleksii’s story,24-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/from-ukraine-to-scotland-olga-and-oleksiis-story/,"Today marks one year since the beginning of Russia’s war against Ukraine. We spoke to two Ukrainians, Olga and Oleksii, who have come to Scotland to seek safety and now live in Glasgow. Olga has a seven-year-old girl who now attends primary school in the city. “When she first started school she cried because she couldn’t speak any English, only Polish,” says Olga. “Now, she has made a lot of friends, including a Polish girl and many Scottish girls.” Olga and her daughter have been placed in a hotel in the city centre since June 2022. “It’s okay. It’s a hotel, you know?” says Olga. “It doesn’t have a kitchen. We can’t cook, we can’t clean.” “It’s not very healthy for kids. You can buy things from shops but nothing that you need to prepare.” Olga is searching for work and has been spending her time filling in job applications. She is struggling with because of the language barrier and because of her childcare needs. They are both anxious to leave the hotel and set up homes. Olga feels tied to Glasgow because her daughter is settling into her school, but she is open to moving to another part of the country. “I prefer smaller towns to big cities,” she says. Olga and Oleksii have been trying to visit other towns and cities in Scotland when they can. Olga says she loved Dunbar and seeing the ocean. Oleksii spends a lot of his time playing for the Amputee Football Association Scotland . Growing up, Oleksii loved football and played from childhood up till the age of 23. He was waiting for physio treatment at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow when he saw a leaflet for the team. “My dream of playing football has come true.” As well as continuing to play football, Oleksii hopes to open his own cleaning company in Scotland. At the moment he is filling in mountains of paperwork and seeing if he can get a businesses off the ground. “You can’t get credit if you have lived in Scotland for less than three years,” he explains. When asked about the future, both Olga and Oleksii seem very uncertain. “All of our plans have died,” says Olga. “Six months ago, victory for Ukraine seemed close. Now, it feels very far away.” Both Olga and Oleksii have family who are still in Ukraine and feel unable to leave. Although both Olga and Oleksii are grateful to be safe, they both say they don’t feel at home in Scotland yet. “Honestly, it is very hard. The language barrier is difficult. Finding employment is difficult. The mentality here is so different. Everything is very different, you drive on the other side of the road here.” Despite struggling to settle into Scottish life, they both stress that they feel lucky to be safe. “Here, we don’t really have any problems. We have a doctor, we have food, we have school, we have the hotel”, says Olga. “We don’t live on the street, we don’t see Russian soldiers. “It is very very difficult for people in Ukraine. By comparison, we are in paradise. “It’s a horrible situation, we are grateful not to be in it.” Another tricky element is the food on offer in Glasgow. Having no kitchen means the food they have access to is very limited. Both Olga and Oleksii say it would make a big difference to their lives if they had more access to Ukrainian food. “Scottish food is not like Ukrainian food. In Ukraine, our food is a big of mix cuisines; Italian and Polish and many more.” They do single out two Scottish delicacies they enjoy: haggis and black pudding. Olga says that black pudding reminds her of a food from home – kravianka – which is a small sausage made from buck-wheat and pig’s blood. When asked if anything has surprised them about Scotland, they both say the same thing: the people. “The Scottish people have surprised us. They are so kind, friendly, always have a smile on their face. Everyone says ‘sorry’ and ‘excuse me.’ It’s not like that in Ukraine.” One year on from the beginning of the war against Ukraine, find out more about our response.

Scottish Refugee Council,Home Secretary must stop far right targeting of asylum hotels,23-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/home-secretary-must-stop-far-right-targeting-of-asylum-hotels/,"The threatening and hostile actions of far right extremists towards people in asylum hotels is putting individuals and communities at risk. We’re disgusted by the hostility shown towards people who are here in the UK seeking a safe place to rebuild their lives. We understand community tensions and concerns about the availability of services in areas that are already suffering from underinvestment and the cost of living crisis. But these concerns are being exploited by extremists and racists, emboldened, we believe, by the UK Government’s failure to show responsible leadership on asylum policy. We have written today to the Home Secretary to remind her of the Home Office’s powers and responsibilities regarding community cohesion, race relations and equalities. The letter, which expresses out deep concern at the situation, sets out a five point plan we urge the Home Secretary to adopt: Stop using irresponsible and inflammatory language when discussing people seeking protection Deliver an asylum system that is fit for purpose, that meets people’s needs and is underpinned by adequate investment targeted at communities’ and individuals’ needs Apply a zero-tolerance policy towards far-right extremism Proactively and consistently monitor community tensions Invest in communities that host new arrivals and consult and involve them in decision-making Our CEO Sabir Zazai said “The Home Secretary must step up now and take responsibility for this situation. There has been a dreadful lack of responsible leadership around asylum in the UK for too long. That kind of gap in leadership creates the conditions where extremists feel emboldened, with deeply troubling and frightening consequences.” We have also written to Scottish authorities, including the police, outlining our concerns and requesting their support in this call for responsible leadership.

Scottish Refugee Council,Sewing2gether for Ukraine,23-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/sewing2gether-for-ukraine/,"Young people in Paisley are Sewing2gether for Ukraine. Gathered happily around sewing machines amidst an avalanche of cushion stuffing, young people at Mossvale Primary School in Paisley are coming together to show support for Ukraine and their new Ukrainian classmates. In fun-filled weekly workshops run by Gabi at Sewing2gether, who also co-runs community group Sewing2gether All Nations , Primary 7 pupils are taught how to sew. The kids are split into 5 groups over 5 weeks, and then on the 6 th week, Ukrainian parents and carers come in to learn sewing skills from the group. It’s all thanks to headteacher Jane Houston, who was keen to provide an activity within the school to welcome their new Ukrainian families. Teachers at the school tell us how popular the workshops are, with all the kids wanting to get involved. And it’s clear why. Everyone in the group is having a great time. This week, the group is making cooking bags to send to Ukraine. This involves removing the insides from pillows and cushions and stuffing it into upcycled duvets which will be sewn up into cooking bags. What’s a cooking bag, and why might somebody need one? Cooking bags for Ukraine. In Ukraine, people are living with limited gas and electricity. The cooking bags act as a slow-cooker. People can part-cook their meals when they have power, and then keep their food hot when the power cuts out. This is all the more poignant as among the group are kids who have fled Ukraine recently. The family are now living in a nearby hotel. Their mum is here too, and they’re teaching her how to use the machines. The idea for the cooking bags came from Sally Pritchard and Fiona McGovern at The Castlemilk Pantry, who Gabi runs another sewing group with – Sew Fabulous. Sew Fabulous and Mossvale Primary’s efforts will soon be joined by Highpark Primary in Glasgow. And of course, Sewing2gether All Nations are getting involved too. Another attendee is a woman from Ukraine who had a long career in textiles and, until fleeing Ukraine, sewed wedding dresses. She has been volunteering with Sewing2gether since arriving in Scotland four months ago. She is also currently living in a nearby hotel and is hoping to find work. One of the kids, from Paisley, tells us that she got a Ukrainian phrase book for Christmas, and has been learning phrases to help her connect with her new classmates. In just a month, she’s picked up not only basic phrases, but a good accent too. She chats away with another girl from Ukraine who only joined the school one week before. At the end of the workshop, the group shares any new Ukrainian phrases they learned that day. The headteacher tells us that there were other Ukrainian families here, who have recently been resettled to another area and school, but that they would always be welcome back to join in on these workshops and other community events. This cultural, intergenerational exchange is important. As Gabi says, “Kids are more comfortable just trying new languages and chatting away. And for adults, in my experience running these workshops anyway, they might feel more comfortable trying out new phrases in this setting.” Sewing2gether for integration and community The school is home to children from many backgrounds and nationalities. The team here works hard to create opportunities for their young people to connect and integrate. And what better way than a couple of hours of learning new, practical, lifelong skills, while doing something to help others? Our Regional Integration Coordinator, Dumie (pictured above sewing a pencil case) , speaks to the class, telling them that he also arrived in Scotland as a refugee. He explains how, even if someone arriving as a refugee moves somewhere else quickly, they’ll always remember the first people who helped them out. The bell rings, and the kids run out to the playground. They’ve learned some new words, they’ve had different conversations and met new people, they’ve created something with their own hands which will make someone’s life even a little bit better, and they’ve had fun while doing so. And it’s something they’ll remember for a long time. All in a day’s work for Sewing2gether. Gabi knows that in these troubled times, there’s nothing like making something to help you (and others too) feel more at home. Author: Chris Afuakwah Communities"
Scottish Refugee Council,Ukraine response one year on,22-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/ukraine-response-one-year-on/,"One year on, we look back on our response to the war against Ukraine. In February 2022, the world watched on in horror as Russia launched a full-scale war of aggression against the people of Ukraine. Since the fighting began, thousands of lives have been lost and millions of people have been uprooted from their homes. When the Homes For Ukraine scheme launched in March 2022, thousands of people across Scotland signed up to host Ukrainian refugees. The Scottish Government became a ‘super sponsor’ enabling people fleeing the war to secure visas without having to arrange a private sponsor first. In the last 12 months, nearly 23,000 people fleeing the war against Ukraine have arrived in Scotland in search of safety. We have helped shape Scotland’s emergency response and expanded our services to offer information, advice and support to even more people at this crucial moment. Here are some of the ways we’re helping. Standing up for the rights of seasonal workers When the war broke out, seasonal workers from Ukraine who were in the UK on temporary visas were left in limbo. Unable to return to their war-torn homes, traumatised people were faced with the possibility of remaining in the UK with nowhere to live and no way of earning a living once their visas expired. We successfully campaigned for the Home Office to give seasonal workers from Ukraine the right to live and work in the UK for up to three years. Welcoming new arrivals We’ve recruited a team of dedicated volunteers to help us meet and greet Ukrainians arriving at Glasgow airport. With their support, we’ve welcomed more than 1,200 men, women and children since March 2022. Our volunteers offer a friendly face for people who often arrive exhausted and traumatised. They provide essential information and accompanying new arrivals to the nearby hub run by Renfrewshire Council Resettlement Team. Tetiana came to Scotland in July and was soon volunteering to greet other Ukrainians when they arrived. She said: “The best thing is feeling that you are useful and can help somebody. I know how it feels when you come to a strange country for the first time. You don’t know what tomorrow will be or where you will stay. It’s really scary. “When I arrived, I was so scared. I had read about what to do but I didn’t know how it would be. It’s really great when there’s someone you can ask. Even more when they can speak to you in your own language.” Hear more from some of our amazing meet and greet volunteers. Helpline Since the war began, 29% of calls to our national helpline have been about the situation in Ukraine. Between March and December 2022, our helpline advisers answered close to 3,000 calls and emails relating to Ukraine. We’re responding to queries from people fleeing Ukraine, people who have volunteered to host new arrivals, and organisations across Scotland that are providing support. Viktor* first contacted our helpline before making the journey to Scotland. Our advisers were able to reassure him and provide holistic support. He and his family are now settling in to their new community and are very grateful for the advice they’ve received. He said: “I would like to tell you many thanks from my family. When we arrived to UK you helped us a lot at a time when we were confused and did not understand what we needed to do.” Empowering Ukrainian communities We’re working with local authorities, the public sector, refugee-supporting groups and people arriving from Ukraine to create Community Integration Networks across Scotland. These networks bring a range of partners together to work at a community level to ensure Ukrainians are represented and can access the support and services they need. Ukrainian Community Integration Networks have been established in Dundee, Glasgow, the Highlands and Perth and Kinross. And talks about starting new networks are underway in communities across Scotland. We’ve also established a Ukrainian Collective to represent Ukrainians living in Scotland and advocate on their behalf. The group is made up of volunteers from Ukraine who come together to discuss key issues affecting their communities. They then come up with practical solutions which will inform and influence the Scottish Government and other service providers. Community Development Officer, Andrii Nadych, helps coordinate the Collective. He said: “It’s not just about consulting people about the challenges they are facing but also asking for their input on solutions that could help them and others in their communities.” Read more about how we’re supporting Ukrainian communities in Scotland. Providing information and advice Many new arrivals spend their first few weeks or months in hotels before moving into more permanent homes.  Last summer, the Scottish Government also contracted two cruise ships to provide temporary accommodation for more than 2,500 people. The HMS Ambition is docked in Glasgow and the HMS Victoria in Edinburgh. We’re working closely with local authorities across Scotland to support people in temporary accommodation. In response to news that the Scottish Government contract with the HMS Ambition will end on 31 March, we’re holding weekly drop-in sessions on the ship. Our expert advisers are on hand to provide information and offer reassurance. We’re also working closely with partners to help connect refugees with suitable hosts. People attending the sessions are invited to provide anonymous feedback: “Thank you very much for the meeting. There was a lot of useful information and everything was clearly explained.” “Ця сесія була дуже корисною, дякую за надану інформацію” (This session was very helpful. Thanks for the information.) “Все дуже гарно пояснили ,на всі питання отримала відповідь.” (Everything was explained very well. All questions were answered.) “Cегодня было и так всё понятно, спасибо большое вам всем за поддержку и помощь” (Today everything was clear. Thank you very much for all your support and help.) Helping people feel at home in Scotland Our integration team is supporting more than 460 households from Ukraine to settle and feel at home in communities across Scotland. We hold regular information sessions to ensure that new arrivals understand their rights and know how to access vital services. More than 790 people have attended our sessions. We’re providing vital information and advice on everything from enrolling children in school and registering for healthcare, to setting up a bank account, applying for benefits and finding work. We also make people aware of  housing options and work with local authorities and hosts in communities across Scotland to help Ukrainians find suitable accommodation. Nastasiya* recently arrived from Ukraine. She told us: “I would like to thank you for your understanding, support and help. Moving to Scotland is a big challenge for each of us, but with your help we manage to integrate quickly.” Find out more about our Ukraine response and the support we provide Our work is only possible thanks to people like you.

Scottish Refugee Council,Demonstration planned to mark anniversary of war against Ukraine,21-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/demonstration-planned-to-mark-anniversary-of-war-against-ukraine/,"Friday the 24th February marks one year since Russia started its war against Ukraine. Over eight million people have been forced to leave Ukraine, and another five million have been internally displaced. Almost 23,000 people from Ukraine have travelled to Scotland seeking safety. To highlight the ongoing plight of those in Ukraine, the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain has organised a demonstration in Glasgow .

But we need your support. “We call upon the people of Glasgow for your much needed moral support.” Minister Neil Gray will be among the speakers at the event. The demonstration will be followed by a march through the city centre.

Scottish Refugee Council,Welcoming people fleeing Ukraine,20-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/welcoming-people-fleeing-ukraine/,"Meet the incredible volunteers making sure Ukrainians arriving at Glasgow airport receive a warm welcome. Russia’s war against Ukraine has forced millions of people from their homes. Almost 23,000 men, women and children have arrived in Scotland in search of safety. At Glasgow airport, a special group of dedicated volunteers are on hand to greet people fleeing the war against Ukraine. They are a friendly face, offering reassurance and a warm Scottish welcome to people who often arrive exhausted and traumatised. With the support of our meet and greet volunteers, we’ve welcomed more than 1,200 people displaced from Ukraine since March 2022. Our volunteers provide people with essential information as soon as they arrive in Scotland and accompany them to the nearby hub run by Renfrewshire Council Resettlement Team . We caught up with some of our volunteers to find out more. Carol “I definitely think about people after I’ve helped them.  I’ll reflect on what happened. You can’t help but compare it to your own situation. “Sometimes you’ll have a proper chat when you’re waiting for the resettlement team. They’ll show you pictures of the wreckage that used to be their family home on their phone. It’s eye-opening. You see it on the news but when it’s on a one-to-one personal basis it’s so much more real. “The news always focuses on the war itself. There’s a lot of individuals who are just normal people who want to live a normal life. They want to get a job, settle, bring up their families. The media focuses on trauma and warfare and not the everyday hopes and aspirations of the people affected.” Tetiana “The best thing about being a volunteer is the feeling that you are useful here. I know how it feels when you come to a strange country for the first time. You don’t know what tomorrow will be or where you will stay. It’s really scary. “I came to Scotland from Ukraine in July. When I arrived, I was so scared. I had read about what to do but I didn’t know how it would be. It’s really great when there’s someone you can ask. Even more when they can speak to you in your own language. “I saw that Scottish Refugee Council were looking for volunteers at Glasgow airport and I thought it would be a great experience for me. At the interview I saw the number of people who wanted to be a volunteer for this project and I was like ‘wow’. All these people who are doing this for nothing, just to welcome people here in Scotland.” “For me it’s really great that I have an opportunity to chat with other volunteers while I have a shift. I really appreciate these moments and am really glad that I have a lot of new friends now. Gillian “News coverage of the war in Ukraine was devastating and I wanted to do more than feel sympathy for those affected. Getting involved with Scottish Refugee Council to support Ukrainians arriving into Scotland seemed a practical way to help. “The best thing about volunteering is being in a position to offer a warm welcome to people who are feeling dismayed, displaced and anxious about what will happen to them. Although our role in the whole process is limited, that initial welcome can make a difference for people on a very difficult journey. “Trying to understand (and explain) the limited coordination between councils (and other agencies) can be challenging.  Families and friends trying to reunite can be blocked by ‘the process’ which seems unnecessarily cruel. The internal structures don’t seem to be able to offer the flexibility required to make decisions based on the human experience.  I understand it’s a large operation and processes are required by the authorities to manage the numbers involved but sometimes it feels more process driven than people centric. ” Sharron “I had no space to host anyone but I still wanted to help. This was something I could actually do. It’s a big thing, being the first face they’ve dealt with when they get here. They often remember you. “There was once a lady with a baby who arrived with no luggage. Normally just travelling with a baby requires all sorts of baggage. They literally had nothing with them. “Having Olga, a Russian speaker, [as a fellow volunteer] was so helpful. You do get people who are traumatised, who are very upset, having a Russian speaker really helped. “Ukrainian is a hard language to learn. I’ve been using the SayHi app . We found out about it from the refugees. It’s way better than Google Translate. We always recommend it to the hosts. “We do get to know the hosts. They’ve told me some lovely things about communities who have pulled together to support somebody. Some of those stories are really interesting. “We used to play a game where we tried to spot hosts waiting at the airport. Sometimes their kids had made welcome signs for the refugees, sometimes they’d tried to write it in Ukrainian. Olga “When people arrive, you see their faces and they are so scared and traumatised. You see kids with only one backpack and you realise they left everything behind. Their past life, their future plans; everything was wiped out in one night. Then when someone is there to greet them, when they hear your voice and they hear that you speak their language you can see their smile. “I have Ukrainian background and have a lot of family there. When the war happened, I felt very guilty that I’m here safe and comfortable in Scotland. I wanted to find ways that I could help. Then I saw the appeal for meet and greet volunteers and I thought that was a good option. I have the language skills and cultural knowledge and thought I can be useful. I can select shifts in the evening and weekends so I can fit it around my job. “When you arrive for your shift, you get to see how people are settling in. You keep meeting all these faces that you first met when they arrived at the airport three months ago and they start to tell you how they’re getting on. They’ve started at college. They’ve got a job. It’s amazing to see their progression.” Alex “I started volunteering out of a sense of rage and frustration at what was happening and an urge to do something to help. What we do is simple but really valuable. It’s rewarding. It’s different seeing it first-hand: it’s not the same as what you see on the news. “Sometimes now I see some of the people I welcomed at the hotel months on and I wonder why they’re still there and how they feel about it. “The sight that always stays with me is the ladies who come with kids – they all have one small suitcase each and they have to start a new life with that. I find that fascinating. I left Serbia with one small suitcase 30 years ago.” Irina “I remember many people who arrived. It’s hard to single anyone out, they all have their own sad stories. And I hope that I was able to make sure that their first visit wasn’t so hard emotionally. “I started volunteering with Scottish Refugee Council in August. The main thing I do is volunteer at the Welcome Desk at the airport. This is a bit of a new role for me. I’ve always helped pets who had been abandoned. Now I just wanted to help people who are coming to another country for the first time, and many of them don’t know the language. “It’s not like they’re going to travel [for a holiday]. There is the war in our country and there’s nothing left but chaos. “I’m happy to work with everyone at the Scottish Refugee Council. They are the most wonderful people.” Read more about our Ukraine response and how we’re helping people fleeing the war against Ukraine to feel at home in Scotland. Author: Rachel Lamb Ukraine"
Scottish Refugee Council,Syria and Turkey earthquake,18-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/syria-turkey-earthquake/,"Millions of lives have been turned upside down following the deadly earthquake in Syria and Turkey. Find out what we’re doing in response and how people in Scotland can support the relief effort. Reports from the region are horrific and heart-breaking. An estimated 47,000 people have died. Millions more are homeless. Two weeks after the initial quakes, secondary tremors have caused further buildings to collapse. As well as the terrible loss of life, huge numbers of people are unable to return to their homes. The area already hosts many thousands of refugees and displaced people whose lives have been torn apart by the war in Syria. Our thoughts and deep sympathy are with those who have family and loved ones in the region. This includes many people we work with, wider communities in Scotland, and members of our staff and volunteer team. What we’re doing in response We are calling for a rapid UK response to allow people with family in the affected area to bring them to safety in the UK.

Scottish Refugee Council,Giving Ukrainians in Scotland a voice,16-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/giving-ukrainians-a-voice/,"Community Development Officer, Andrii Nadych, helps Ukrainians seeking safety in Scotland to feel represented and play an active role in their new communities. We caught up with him to find out more about his job and how his work is giving people displaced from Ukraine a voice. Hi Andrii, can you tell us a bit about what you do? I’m working with Ukrainian communities that have settled in Scotland to connect them and make sure they are involved in discussions with the Scottish Government and local authorities. My role is supporting people to share their opinions, skills and knowledge and feel more empowered in decision making. I coordinate a Ukrainian Collective. The idea is to bring together representatives from the Ukrainian community to discuss the issues affecting their communities and propose ideas which can improve their situation. It’s not just about consulting people about the challenges they are facing but also asking for their input on solutions that could help them and others in their communities. Why did you want to work for Scottish Refugee Council? I have links with the Ukrainian community and experience in the charity sector and I wanted to use my skills and knowledge to improve the situation of people in Scotland. I’d heard about Scottish Refugee Council and its reputation of involving communities. I really wanted to be involved in this work to support the Ukrainian community and the refugee community in general. Working in charity sector can be difficult but it is also very rewarding. You get to meet many people who share your views and your desire to help people. What’s the best thing about your job? Being involved in the communities. I meet so many people with great knowledge, great skills and a great attitude. Involving people and empowering them to use all the experience they have to benefit others is very rewarding. You don’t always see immediate results but you can see your efforts pay off eventually and how the work you do is improving the life of the community. What do you find most challenging? When you don’t have the power to make the changes that would help people. You might understand their pain but you feel powerless because you can’t change the systems that have caused their situation. It’s frustrating when you know the issue but you can’t do anything to fix it. What do you like to do when you’re not at work? Reading, sport and spending time with my family. I’m pretty keen on classical literature and psychology and philosophy. I also like cycling, football, swimming. Playing with my two-year-old son is one of the best ways to forget about the issues and focus on the simple things. Children make you think about the world in different ways. Tell us something interesting about you. I missed the birth of my son because of work. In 2020, I was working for the International Red Cross in Libya. I was supposed to be back in Ukraine by April. Then Covid restrictions started and all the planes were cancelled. I wasn’t able to travel and be with my wife when she delivered. The good part is that I eventually managed to get a flight back to Ukraine. I first saw my son when he was two months old. I guess one day my wife will forgive me and see the funny side.

Scottish Refugee Council,Supporting Ukrainian communities in Scotland,16-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/supporting-ukrainian-communities-in-scotland/,"We’re working closely with communities across Scotland to ensure people fleeing the war against Ukraine feel welcome and are receiving the right services and support. Since March 2022, nearly 23,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Scotland in search of safety. Thousands of people across the country have signed up to host people displaced from Ukraine. Scottish Refugee Council is working in partnership with the Scottish Government , COSLA other organisations across the country to help people displaced from Ukraine feel at home in Scotland and play an active role in their new communities. We identify, mobilise and coordinate community groups and support them to work alongside local authorities to understand and address the needs of people arriving from Ukraine. And coordinate support from local communities Creating Community Networks We’re working with local authorities, national organisations, the public sector, refugee-supporting groups and people from Ukraine to create Community Integration Networks across Scotland. The networks bring a range of partners together to discuss issues on a community level and work with one another to ensure Ukrainians are represented and can access the support and services they need. This approach aims to improve communication, collaboration and understanding between different organisations so they can work more efficiently and effectively together. It also helps build a better picture of the needs of new arrivals and the specific issues they face in each local authority area. Ruby Serber, the Regional Integration Coordinator for our Ukraine response said: “So many things go into creating a life that you don’t necessarily think about until you’ve had to leave your home and start again somewhere new. When I set up my first Community Integration Network in Perth and Kinross and it went well, I could see that what I was doing was actually useful to people. Meeting others who are in a similar situation to you is massive, as is knowing that you have people there who can help you.” Ukrainian Community Integration Networks have been established in Dundee, Glasgow, the Highlands and Perth and Kinross. Talks about starting new networks are also underway in communities across Scotland. A member of the Highland Community Integration Network told us: “I am finding the meetings really helpful and increasingly useful. Thanks also for welcoming Ira [a member of the Ukrainian community]. I’m sure she’ll be an asset and has already proved her worth by highlighting a really important issue.” Read Ruby’s staff story to find out more about how she helps synchronise community support for people displaced from Ukraine. Establishing a Ukrainian Collective Working alongside local communities, we’ve established a Ukrainian Collective to represent Ukrainians living in Scotland and advocate on their behalf. The Collective is made up of volunteers from Ukraine who come together to discuss key issues affecting their communities. They then propose practical solutions which will inform and influence the Scottish Government and other service providers. Community Development Officer, Andrii Nadych, helps coordinate the Collective. He said: “It’s not just about consulting people about the challenges they are facing but also asking for their input on solutions that could help them and others in their communities.” “It makes me happy to see Ukrainians using their knowledge and qualifications to improve the situation for other Ukrainians in Scotland. I’m excited to see the results. It’s important that some solutions are suggested based on the opinion and experience of communities affected. “It’s good to see refugee communities treated as people with a contribution and an opinion that matters. They can feel empowered and are not just subjects of some decision. They can be active in making their life easier and the life of their community easier.” Read Andrii’s staff story to find out more about how he’s helping Ukrainians to play an active role in their new communities. Giving Ukrainians in Scotland a voice The Collective is split into three subject groups, one for each of the main issues: language barriers; employment; and accommodation. All three groups met in person at a gathering in Edinburgh on 18 February to present on their findings and share their ideas. Oleksandr Chernykh, a lawyer who is currently living in Aberdeen, chairs The Employment Group. He said: “There are teachers, doctors, accountants, oil industry specialists but they can’t find work [in their area of expertise] because their qualifications aren’t recognised in the UK. Employers don’t want to take us because they don’t know how long we will stay here. “It’s very important that Ukrainians are involved in finding solutions. All of us have different experiences. It’s important that we have a voice in Scotland. We are here today because someone is listening to us.” Oleksandra Novatska, an artist and designer based in Dumfries, chairs the Language Group. She said: “Back in Ukraine, we had a lot of Crimean refugees in our area so I know some of the problems that people face and how integration works. I have experience in how to solve problems through culture. For me The Language Group is also about culture, not just language. I know we’ll find some solutions and we can help people.” “I was very happy to know there was an organisation like Scottish Refugee Council here. It’s difficult for people to go from one problem – the war – to another problem – being a displaced person. When you come from a different culture, you don’t know what’s going on. When you find some help, it’s really great.” Read more about our Ukraine response Author: Rachel Lamb Ukraine"
Scottish Refugee Council,Call for party leaders to take stand against violence,14-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/call-for-party-leaders-to-take-stand-against-violence/,"We have signed an open letter , along with 180 organisations and charities, calling for all political party leaders to take a stand against violence and hateful language towards people seeking protection. The letter is in response to a deeply worrying incident in Knowsley on Friday outside a hotel where people seeking asylum were housed. Fifteen people have since been arrested following the violent clashes. In response to the attacks, our CEO Sabir Zazai has called for an emphasis on ‘basic human decency’ rather than ‘party politics’. He said: “These are vulnerable people who have already suffered and struggled to find safety.  They need our compassion not hatred. This isn’t about party politics, it’s about basic human decency. The very least all political leaders could do is to condemn the attack on people seeking sanctuary in our communities. Leaders of all political parties must call for the ending of these hostile policies and hateful language that only fuels division and anger. “We all have shared duty to nurture our cohesion and strengthen what bind us together as communities in these challenging times.” The open letter, coordinated by Together with Refugees , states: “Those who incite this anger and violence bring shame on this country, on the vast majority who are proud of our history of helping those in danger around the world. This does not reflect the people of Britain. This is not who we are.” We have also expressed concern over recent unrest in Erskine over the housing of people seeking asylum in hotels. We have called on the Home Office, the Scottish government and local councils to work together to support communities in welcoming people seeking protection. Author: Gilly Furmage"

Scottish Refugee Council,Community Concern at Hotel Accommodation,07-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/community-concern-at-hotel-accommodation/,"We’re concerned that the Home Office’s use of hotels to house people seeking asylum is causing anxiety and stress in local areas. Last weekend we saw this anxiety inflamed and exploited by far-right agitators, intent on stirring up division and racism. We’re disgusted to see this and are worried about the wellbeing of the individuals in the hotel and other hotels where similar demonstrations have taken place.  We were heartened to hear the local community in Erskine distance themselves from the far-right demonstrators .  But, concerns in this community remain. We have long called for an end to the Home Office’s use of hotel rooms as accommodation for people seeking asylum. Hotels are not appropriate places for people who have recently arrived here seeking refugee protection. We know from experience that housing people in hotel rooms can be extremely isolating, preventing people from becoming involved in the local community, getting to know those around them and taking steps to rebuild their lives in peace and safety. The Home Office is responsible for providing housing for people seeking asylum. In recent years they have used hotels and other institutional, inappropriate accommodation more and more frequently, prioritising private interests and profits over the needs of local communities and the people affected. Those living in these hotels are most often experiencing extreme poverty, living on as a little as £1.30 a day, and are denied the right to work to support themselves. They face violence and persecution if they were to return to their home countries. We call on the Home Office, their subcontractor Mears, the Scottish government and local councils to work together to support communities in welcoming people in need of protection, and to make sure that communities are consulted and have an input on future plans. We hope that people can come together and are given whatever resources are necessary to understand one another. We have reached out to local organisations to see how we can help. FACT CHECK: THE FIGURES Where are people seeking asylum housed in hotels originally from? The five countries most people have fled from are Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan. What are people in hotel accommodation entitled to? People seeking asylum are not eligible for universal credit and must survive on as little as £1.30 a day. How long is the typical length of stay in this temporary accommodation? Seven months; the duration is linked to lengthy waits for asylum decisions from the Home Office. Why are hotels being used more often? The Home Office is spending huge sums of money on contracts with private hotel companies. None of this money goes back into the local communities. CALLING FOR CHANGE As Scotland’s national refugee charity, we never stop campaigning for a fairer and more humane approach to asylum and a better deal for people seeking safety. Following news that 200 children have gone missing from hotels, we’ve joined over 100 charities calling for the Prime Minister to stop placing vulnerable children seeking protection in hotels.

Scottish Refugee Council,Meet the Inclusive Homework Club,07-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/meet-the-inclusive-homework-club/,"We visited the Inclusive Homework Club, one of the projects funded by the Reaching New Scots Fund. Their ESOL and IT Skills projects are supporting adults to pursue further education, improve their employment prospects and even enable them to support their children with their homework. Glasgow Clyde College provides qualified lecturers to lead the courses. The project grew out of discussions between Inclusive Homework Club (IHWC), parents in the community, and other local organisations such as CWIN . When we visited, we first met with Firdaus, founder of IHWC, and Project Coordinator Carly to hear all about how the project is going. They talked about how there are not enough English language classes for the demand in Glasgow, and shared the positive impacts the project is having on their participants. We also heard about some of the barriers people face when attending classes. These included travel and childcare costs, mismatched skill levels, or unsuitable timings (particularly for parents who need to pick up kids from school). IHWC are now adapting to the needs of their community – adding new skill levels, adapting their timings, and ensuring that travel costs are factored into their budget moving forward. Nufailah’s story Nufailah came to the UK 12 years ago and has 4 children, 3 of whom participate in our after-school Homework Club. She often comes with her children and enjoys the learning environment both for her children’s sake and her own. It is because of her children that she was inspired to register for the Click2Connect course. Her children frequently need to use a computer to complete their homework, and she had difficulty helping them because she had not used a computer at all since she came to the UK. Her son, who is in P7, would ask for help, and she says that she ‘didn’t know [how to help] so [she] need[s] to learn’. Nufailah reported a high level of enjoyment in the course and how it has changed her life. The lecturer was very helpful and she is happy that she can now have an email address and send emails, allowing her to be in better contact with friends and family back home. She is also very confident now in helping her children with their schoolwork at home. In addition to this, Nufailah also feels more confident in her ability to apply to jobs, especially now that she can put on her CV that she has completed an SCQF level 3 computer skills course and fill out online applications. College pursuits are on the horizon for Nufailah. She has indicated interest in taking the next level Click2Connect class, and even applying for college in the future. As a testament to her increased skills and confidence on the computer, Nufailah has agreed to volunteer as an assistant on the computer skills classes that are put on after her course finishes. In the classroom After chatting with Firdaus and Carly, we were invited to see the work of the Homework Club in action. Their IT Skills class, known as Click2Connect, was in full swing, with participants working their way through a series of tasks. This week, they were setting up email accounts and practicing sending emails.  This ensured that the group was not only learning IT skills, but practicing English language skills too. We sat with the learners and heard all about how the course was going for them, and their hopes for future learning. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, with everyone helping each other out. Soran’s story Soran came to the UK seeking safety and has completed our 8-week Click2Connect computer skills class. He studied at university and earned a Bachelor’s degree in his home country, but has struggled to find work in the UK in the year and a half he has been here. In conversation with him, he said that he is interested in IT as a possible career because ‘you just need to show your skill rather than requiring a qualification’. A big hurdle that he has been trying to overcome are his English language skills and confidence in using English and computers. Because of Soran’s interests in gaining additional computer skills and improving his English, he decided to register for our class. The material on the course was generally review for him, but there were two big areas that being in the class helped him with: increasing his confidence in using English and giving him a first qualification (at SCQF level 3) in computers that will help him get into college. Soran is now more confident speaking with people he doesn’t know as well as more confident in using the computer. The class also offered him an opportunity to meet and socialise with other people in his new community, which he indicated was a benefit to taking the class. Soren’s goal is to register for college and complete the NQ Software Development Course. He says that ‘the world is changing and we have to change our mindsets. We don’t need more paperwork. We can do a lot of things on the computer and help our environment’. He is currently in the process of applying to college with the assistance of our Project Coordinator.

Scottish Refugee Council,Calls for Rishi Sunak to stop placing children in hotels,01-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/calls-for-rishi-sunak-to-stop-placing-children-in-hotels/,"We have written to the Prime Minister, along with 100 charities, to call for an end to placing vulnerable children in hotels. The letter follows the alarming news that 200 children seeking protection in the UK have gone missing from hotels . The Observer reported claims that some children had been abducted off the street outside the accommodation and rushed into cars. Patricia Durr, CEO of Every Child Protected Against Trafficking, said: “This is a national child protection failure – the shocking but inevitable consequence of the Home Office practice of directly accommodating separated children outside of the law. The Home Office has no authority, power or expertise in the care and protection of children.” The letter states: “There is no legal basis for placing children in Home Office hotel accommodation and almost two years into the operation of the scheme which is both unlawful and harmful, it is no longer possible to justify the use of hotels as being ‘temporary’.” The open letter has been signed by leading UK charities including NSPCC, Barnardo’s and Action for Children. We have wider concerns that the Home Office’s use of hotels to accommodate people seeking asylum is causing anxiety and stress in some local areas. Read more.

Scottish Refugee Council,Reaching New Scots Fund,01-Feb-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/reaching-new-scots-fund/,"What is the Reaching New Scots Fund? In August 2021, 56 projects across Scotland were awarded funding by the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). Many community groups we work with applied for this funding but were unsuccessful. In 2022, we spoke to the National Lottery Community Fund about other potential funding opportunities. The Reaching New Scots Fund was born. About the assessment panel It was important to us that representatives from new Scots communities were part of the assessment panel. Four people from refugee backgrounds were selected from six applicants. They were paired with four representatives from the National Lottery. One representative: The good thing was our observations and decisions were quite similar. We explained our opinions and learned from each other. It was a friendly environment to talk and exchange views. A National Lottery funding officer: When we met in person, we got on so well and it really brought it home how important this sort of work is; he was able to point out parts of asylum/refugee legislation in the UK that I knew nothing about and it truly brought it home why this sort of participatory work matters. About the funded projects 13 projects received a total of £661k of funding. These projects will take place across Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Edinburgh, Perth, Airdrie and Paisley from July 2022 – December 2023 . Africa Delice will offer cooking classes. Africa Future will set up sewing workshops and continue their existing IT skills project. Bellshill and Mossend YMCA will offer a safe community space for a range of activities. Bield Christian Company Ltd. will lead a creative program for aspiring artists from refugee backgrounds, including residential weekends, workshops and mentoring. Bikes for Refugees SCIO will provide free bikes, volunteering opportunities, accredited bike mechanic training, bike repairs and group activities. Dumfries and Galloway Multicultural Association will provide a welcoming hub for their community. Edinburgh and Lothians Regional Equality Council will support English language learning, build cultural knowledge and improve access to public services. Heart of Africa will host intercultural events and free lunches for unemployed refugees and asylum seekers. Inclusive Homework Club will provide English language lessons and IT skills training. Sewing2gether All Nations will continue their existing sewing workshops which support mental health and social connection. Pachedu will develop a community mental health and well-being toolkit and map based on community consultations. The Welcoming Association will offer self-management and social intelligence classes, volunteering opportunities, and mentoring. Author: Chris Afuakwah Communities"

Scottish Refugee Council,Head of Scottish Refugee Council receives Queen’s honour,31-Jan-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/head-of-scottish-refugee-council-receives-queens-honour/,"We’re very proud of our Chief Executive, Sabir Zazai, who has been presented with an OBE. Sabir was recognised in the Queen’s final birthday honours last June for his work advocating for the rights of people seeking safety. He collected his medal on 18 January in a special ceremony at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. “The occasion made me look back on my shoulder. The first letter I received in the UK read, ‘you are a person liable to be detained.’ The letter I received with the OBE award read, ‘we would like to honour you with an OBE.’ “I never came to the UK in search of honours. Like many others I too arrived in search for safety, protection and acceptance. This award is for all of us, those that stand up for refugee rights and those that are seeking sanctuary.” We caught up with Sabir after he was named in the honours list in June 2022. He told us about his journey from arriving in the UK as a young man seeking safety twenty-three years ago, to being recognised by HRH the Queen for his work advocating for refugee rights. Sabir, congratulations on receiving this honour. It’s been awarded to you in recognition of your work supporting people seeking refugee protection. Can you tell us a bit about this work and what it means to you? I started my first full time job in 2002, working with refugee children in primary education in Coventry. I observed the many barriers families and children encounter through the asylum system, which resonated with my own experiences of the hardship of seeking sanctuary in the UK. When I was younger, I was very inspired by the generosity of the local communities and people that welcomed me to the UK. The culture of volunteerism, solidarity and standing up for one another’s rights and the goodwill of local communities inspired me to turn my own experiences of sufferings and hardships into hope for others. My life as a refugee and refugee rights activist is full of many moments and highlights that continue to empower me to advocate for the rights of others who seek sanctuary. I remember people and communities in Coventry that stood up for our rights to have access to health, dentists, education and shelter. I remember the first time a local activist and good friend, late Penny Walker, took me to a BBC interview or asked me to speak at Coventry Cathedral about refugee experiences. I recall my hands and legs shaking but I knew that we needed a voice and if I didn’t add my lived experiences to the voices of others standing up for refugee rights, it will be hard to secure change. I remember standing in Coventry City Council chambers calling on city leaders for Coventry to become a City of Sanctuary. I was then proud to chair City of Sanctuary and help in promoting and reviving the culture of welcome and hospitality one community and one city at a time. I am immensely grateful to all my colleagues and at Scottish Refugee Council and many partners with whom I have worked closely to secure rights for refugees. In an increasingly regressive refugee and asylum landscape, we have worked together to secure the right for refugees to vote in Scottish parliamentary and local elections. We stopped ‘lock change’ evictions to make those seeking sanctuary homeless and destitute. We successfully campaigned for the Scottish Parliament to stand firm against the UK Government’s cruel anti-refugee bill and recognise that Scotland welcomes refugees. I used my own lived experience to help shape the sectors response to the Nationality and Borders Bill. I am privileged to chair the ‘Asylum Reform Initiative’ and the over 400 members strong ‘Together with Refugees’, working with people from cross section of society to ask for a more humane, effective and efficient asylum system. How did you feel when you found out you’d be receiving an OBE? It comes as a big surprise, but also a great honour in recognition of my work for refugee rights and justice over the last 20 years. But, of course, I know that I do not do this work alone, and while this is a personal honour for me, I believe it is also a recognition of the commitment and contribution of all of us in this struggle together. In accepting the honour, I hope that it also shines a light on both the many incredible people who work tirelessly to welcome refugees – and to the many refugees who have come to the UK to find protection but who then have given so much back. How do you plan to use this honour? I don’t think it will change much in my personal life or my voice and resolve in standing up for refugee rights. But in terms of my work for refugee rights I plan to better influence and to speak out with a stronger voice to make lives better for our new friends, neighbours and colleagues, who are looking to rebuild their lives in our communities. What would you say to people who are having a difficult time right now, whether that’s coping with the stress and anxiety of life in the asylum system, or otherwise dealing with poverty, loneliness and hardship? Hard times come and go just like happy moments in our lives. But we must keep going and never give up hope, celebrate the little gifts in life whether that is friends, family or children. We must stay connected and reach out to one another as we did during the pandemic. It shouldn’t take a pandemic for us to be kind to one another. Small acts of kindness brings the best of humanity in us. These aren’t easy times for us all. There are now 100 million people forced to flee their homes around the globe. These are 100 million people with hopes, aspirations, dreams and family. The pandemic reminded us how interdependent we are on one another’s wellbeing. There is no “us” and “them”. Wherever we see injustice and denial of rights, we must stand together in opposing it. There are many people living through the uncertainty of the asylum system. Seeking asylum isn’t easy. People are denied rights including the important right to work. But my message to everyone is to never give up hope. There are many people who are advocating for your rights. Stay connected and involved and one day you will look back on your journey and celebrate YOUR unique friendships and achievements. I am no exception. I arrived as an asylum seeker in the UK. The community welcomed me and the society invested in me for which I am grateful and today I am proud to lead Scottish Refugee Council, Scotland’s national refugee agency. But every person arriving here also has so much to contribute. We must truly welcome them, celebrate them as equal citizens and invest in their potential. Every refugee has a powerful story of courage, resilience and hope; and every refugee and the people that welcome them deserve an OBE! Author: Pauline D In the news"
Scottish Refugee Council,Photographing New Scots: a best practice guide,24-Jan-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/photographing-new-scots-a-best-practice-guide/,"What is best practice? Groups supporting refugees in Scotland have a duty of care towards the people they support when taking and sharing photographs of them. Someone who has had to flee persecution has been through a lot. Photographers working in this area (whatever background they may be from themselves) must be aware of this and adapt accordingly. The process of creating images should bring people together, building bonds and deepening respect. Done well, good photographs which show the reality of life for new Scots can be a powerful and necessary tool. Best practice guide We have worked with Becky Duncan at Open Aye , and members of our community, to create a best practice guide to refer to when photographing new Scots. View the guide here. We hope that this short guide will help you when planning your event, booking a photographer or taking photographs of your work. We also hope that it will stimulate discussion and we are open to any feedback and thoughts. With thanks to… We are enormously grateful to the knowledge and expertise of Becky Duncan at Open Aye, who put together a brilliant series of collaborative workshops in 2021/22 from which this guide was born. Thanks also to Adam, Ali, Jawad, Joni, Rahma, Soudabeh and Zainab for their enthusiasm and their input in creating this guide.

Scottish Refugee Council,Urgent call for Rishi Sunak to fulfil promise to reunite Afghan families,17-Jan-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/urgent-call-for-rishi-sunak-to-fulfil-promise-to-reunite-afghan-families/,"We have written to the prime minister, alongside over 100 charities and activists, urging him to follow through on his commitment to resettle the families of Afghans who have arrived in the UK. It has been a year since the government launched the Afghan resettlement scheme , known as ACRS. It came with a pledge to help the family members of those who have arrived in the UK, but so far there is still no procedure in place for this . Today’s letter highlights serious concerns about the safety of families who have been separated, women, girls and those from vulnerable religious and ethnic communities who have been left in Afghanistan. Women in Afghanistan are currently subject to oppressive laws, including being banned from attending high school or university, practicing their professions and are subject to arbitrary arrest. An Amnesty International report, Death in Slow Motion: Women and Girls Under Taliban Rule , revealed how women who peacefully protested against these oppressive rules have been threatened, arrested, detained and tortured. A joint investigation by the Observer and Lighthouse Reports also revealed that people the UK pledged to help under the ACRS scheme have been severely beaten and tortured by the Taliban. The letter to Rishi Sunak states: “We are asking you, Prime Minister, to honour the commitments made to Afghan families. Will you today recommit to reunite families separated during the evacuations as the Government promised? Living in uncertainty, Afghan refugees are desperate to know that you have not forgotten their loved ones and will deliver on the promises made as Kabul fell. “Brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and wives were separated in the chaos of trying to get on a flight in August 2021. At the time, your Government rightly recognised that families belong together and promised that those airlifted to safety would be resettled with their loved ones. However, nearly a year and a half on families are being kept apart because no process has been put in place for their reunification under the Afghan Citizen Resettlement Scheme .” We have also written to the Prime Minister to call for an end to placing vulnerable children in hotels. The letter was sent following alarming news that 200 children seeking protection in the UK have gone missing from hotel accommodation. You can read more here.

Scottish Refugee Council,Forgotten Play will raise funds for refugees in Scotland,10-Jan-23,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/forgotten-play-will-raise-funds/,"Students at the University of Glasgow have rediscovered a forgotten play about a Ukrainian refugee. And they’re preparing to perform it for the first time in over 100 years to raise funds for Scottish Refugee Council. The dramatic reading of Tomorrow’s Child , by Fannie Hurst and Harriet Ford, will take place at the University’s James Arnott Theatre on Monday, 16 January. It will be the first time the play has been performed in front of a live audience since it appeared on Broadway in 1917. Tomorrow’s Child tells the story of a young Ukrainian woman, fleeing the upheaval of the Russian Revolution, as she attempts to build a new life in America. Although it was written more than 100 years ago, it mirrors the experiences of people who are currently fleeing war in Ukraine. A Forgotten Play PhD student, Deborah Snow Molloy, came across the forgotten play while researching the work of American writer Fannie Hurst . She said: “I started reading and I just got goose bumps. It’s just so applicable to what is happening today. All those people from Ukraine fleeing for their lives and 100 years later it’s the same thing all over again.” Deborah decided to bring the forgotten play back to the stage and wanted to use this as an opportunity to raise funds for our work supporting people fleeing conflict, persecution and human rights abuses. She added: “I really felt that this was something I had to do. I knew that Scottish Refugee Council was based in Glasgow and everything seemed to align. It’s a tragedy that history is repeating itself in this way, but maybe by sharing this play with a new audience we can do something good to help people.” Tomorrow’s Child Tickets for the performance are free but donations are welcomed at the event. The reading will be followed by a wine reception.

Scottish Refugee Council,Rwanda: High Court rules that cruel scheme is lawful,19-Dec-22,https://scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/rwanda-high-court-rules-that-cruel-scheme-is-lawful/,"We are horrified that the High Court has ruled that the Government’s cruel Rwanda scheme is lawful. The UK Government’s abhorrent UK-Rwanda deal does nothing to fix the UK’s broken asylum system. Instead, it threatens to destabilise the international system of refugee protection. The Rwanda deal is unethical, amoral and damaging. Just because something is legal, does not make it right. The UK Government is failing to uphold its responsibilities to support people in need of safety. We will continue to oppose this inhumane and unworkable policy. Refugee rights are human rights. Refugee rights are all of our rights. The court ruling: in detail According to Detention Action: The court has ruled that it is lawful, and in-keeping with the Refugee Convention and the Human Rights Act 1998, to send people to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed. However, the court deemed that the Home Secretary acted unlawfully in her treatment of the eight individuals who were targeted by the Rwanda policy and that their claims must be reconsidered.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,At Home with the Jesuit Young Adult Ministry,27-Nov-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/at-home-with-the-jesuit-young-adult-ministry/,"To live in a community and to also engage fully in relationships, embracing the experience of getting to know others and others getting to know you, can be a positive, life changing experience. We know that amongst young people there is an increasing sense of loneliness and isolation. Opportunities to learn about oneself, “for better for worse”, in the close company of others who share values, is vitally important. The Jesuit Young Adult Ministry community is for professional young adults who want to explore and deepen their faith. They live together for a year, and as part of this community, pray together, undergo termly formation, and have the responsibility of being a house of hospitality. From November 2022 to July 2023, being a house of hospitality included welcoming a refugee friend to the community through hosting with JRS UK. To achieve a healthy community, some degree of risk taking is involved. The invitation to another person to join an already established community requires some risk taking, too. It is a step into the unknown, away from familiar and comfortable feelings. Stepping into this new dynamic, community members should be aware of potential awkward and challenging features that may be heightened when someone from the outside is invited in. The act of “welcoming the stranger” requires careful preparation and thinking, grounded in best practise guidance. “I think if we all went back to when we first heard the idea of hosting, we all had different viewpoints of what it would be like, and I think we would all say that none of us were correct. We learnt a lot.” Resident We all can remember “first days” in our lives, albeit starting secondary school, college, university or a workplace. Anxiety linked with the unknown is normal and to be expected. Yet we all experience anxiety and apprehension in different ways. “Before our refugee friend moved in, we met with the JRS Accommodation Officer and the Jesuits that led our community, and that gave us a better idea of what to expect and how to prepare for the experience.” Resident “Welcoming the Stranger” requires thoughtfulness about difference in a sensitive way. Difference such as power inequalities, or to be employed alongside a refugee friend who has no access to work opportunities or study. Dynamics such as these should be reflected on, not just in light of identified challenges. “There is a challenge in hospitality to not assume what someone needs but instead to just be present, ready to offer them what they need when they ask for it. It is a challenge in hospitality whether it is a close friend, family, stranger, or refugee friend. We were reminded to give space to our new house mate and to be welcoming but not expecting. By that I mean we have learnt the importance of communicating and openeness, but to allow someone else to live with their own dignity and not feel pressured to join us.” Resident Brixton YAM discovered the importance of sensitivity in communication with their guest. This is a skill, and the development of sensitive communication pays many emotional and relationship dividends. For it is in our continued adult development that we take these “soft” but also vital skills to our places of work, marriages, partnerships, convents and seminaries. It could be said that some of the most important skills for adults to develop is of learning how to negotiate and compromise, to listen to the other. What better environmental training ground than in small communities such as this. “We have learnt the joy that it is to have someone new in the house. We have been able to learn a bit about our refugee friend and hear about his day to day life; his volunteering and experiences. Like with all new people, you have to learn how to get along, and that is always an added challenge when you live together. But we have also learnt how to make each other laugh, to share about ourselves and to be present when needed.” Resident “It has been a very helpful experience for the young adults who have lived here. They’ve formed community and a deepend experience of their own personal faith commitments. It has been great to be able to put formation in Ignation Spirituality into practise by offering hospitality to a refugee friend. Living in community, there can be a risk of looking inwards. We know from our own hosting experiences that welcoming others, with such a diversity of experience, broadens our own outlook.” Fr James Conway, Ignatian Spiritual Director At Home provides our refugee friends with the safe, stable accommodation, and the opportunity to be welcomed to a community. But hosting also offers much to our hosts, too.There is a concerning shortage of accommodation for our refugee friends. This is particularly concerning as we enter the winter months. Our host communities are diverse and each one is unique. If you are wondering if your house or community might be able to host with At Home, please get in touch urgently.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Two years of impactful collaboration: JRS & World Medicine,07-Nov-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/two-years-of-impactful-collaboration-jrs-world-medicine/,"On October 27th, JRS UK and World Medicine (WM) came together to reflect on and celebrate their two-year partnership. It was an opportunity for volunteers from World Medicine (who dedicate their time and expertise to provide refugee friends with acupuncture sessions every week), WM trustees, and staff from JRS to meet one another. Dallya Alhorri, Refugee Activities Coordinator, reflected on how this was a time to celebrate two years of collaboration: “This event served as a platform for all of us to come together and celebrate a remarkable milestone in our partnership. Over the past two years, our two organizations have worked closely, forging a strong bond while making a profound impact on the lives of our refugee friends.” As the day unfolded, attendees seized the opportunity to share their experiences and stories from their time working together. It was a moment to recognize the progress made and the positive difference created in the lives of our refugee friends. The heart warming feedback from World Medicine volunteers was a testament to the transformative impact they have witnessed, adding a special touch to the occasion. Looking Towards the Future: One of the highlights of the event was the discussion of World Medicine’s future plans with JRS UK. We’ll keep you updated as we continue to partner and grow in our relationship with World Medicine to provide acupuncture and wellbeing services to our refugee friends. To learn more about the incredible work of World Medicine, please visit their website atwww.worldmedicine.org.ukand stay tuned for updates on the exciting initiatives to come.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"“I’ve discovered friendship, resilience, good humour and triumph over adversity”",03-Nov-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/ive-discovered-friendship-resilience-good-humour-and-triumph-over-adversity/,"It is a privilege to be a JRS social visitor at Harmondsworth and Colnbrook centres: to be able to share in the frustrations, fears and hopes of some of the people there. I have learnt about the isolation, the feelings of hopelessness, of having no control over timescales for lifechanging decisions, the difficulty of getting legal representation, the absence of family and friends. I’ve also discovered friendship, resilience, good humour and triumph over adversity. In recent months I have enjoyed discussions about family and friends, the nature of good leadership, religious faith, the bible, life beyond detention centres and much more.  Many of the things I have heard in discussion, I have no answers to. Here are some of them. The frustrations ‘It is hard to understand what is being said in meetings and court hearings when you can’t speak English well. Translators are not always clear.’ ‘Why can’t you help me with my casework? What are you here for?’ ‘I’m sorry can we please reschedule. I need to run around and get my report sent to my bail representative.  One of the major frustrations of this place is you think things are done only to be let down in the 11thhour.’ ‘It is summer outside and it is cold in here – the air conditioner is on all the time indoors; it is set at too low a temperature and not even the staff can change it.’ ‘I need to send some money home and the staff here can’t help me.’  The sadness ‘He can’t see you today.  He doesn’t want to leave his room.’ ‘I’ve worked all my life and not being able to work makes me feel useless.  I need to provide for my people.’ ‘It will be tough if the bail hearing doesn’t go well. I’m trying hard not to build my hopes up too much until I have a definite decision about bail.’ ‘I’m worried I might be deported.’ ‘I had settled immigration status. I’m now under threat of deportation after I spent some time in prison.  I’ve been taken hundreds of miles away from home and detained for an indeterminate period.  Prison was easier than this because you knew when the end date was coming. Not knowing how long I will be here, or if I am to be deported is the hardest thing.’ ‘The sudden death of my mother last week has knocked me for six.  I’ve had good support from some of my friends and staff here.  They helped me prepare emotionally for her funeral which I was able to see by video link. It was good to hear from a distance all the fine things said of her but I’m mourning the loss of my future with her.’  The joy ‘I read some of the Psalms every day.  They help me to give thanks and praise to God. Reading the bible is an essential part of my life. Which verses are you going to read for our next meeting?’ ‘Chaplains come from outside to provide services for us.  Wouldn’t it be good if people outside came in to hear us preach to them?’ ‘I’ve been released my brother.  God is so good. I’m on the train heading home.’ ‘It is great to be free, to just go out for a walk. I need to find a church.’ ‘Stay blessed.’  I’ve discovered I don’t need to know all the answers to be able to listen to and accompany such good people. In solidarity and in prayer, Martin Martin is a new Social Visitor, volunteering with our Detention Outreach team. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,“Step back into time”,24-Oct-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/step-back-into-time/,"The good, the bad, the brutal. Who says that going back to the past is not possible? In the Tower of London, it’s certainly possible. The Tower of London encompasses more than 1,000 years of British history. We went to the various displays, King’s Medieval bedroom, prisoner chamber, Medieval Tower, White Tower, Armoury, Sceptres, and Orbs each exhibit is interesting and provides a lot of information. Of course, the crown jewels are stunning. A large number of steps, narrow pathways and numerous doors made our tour more mysterious. The building and artefacts are immaculately maintained. We were fascinated by the many treasures that the Tower of London houses and all the legends and stories of this castle which played a prominent role in English history. Anyway, I feel lucky that I survived and was not executed by the royal executioner and I also hope that the ghost of Anne Boleyn will not haunt me😀 Thanks, JRS. Thank you to Abdul for sharing his reflections with us! [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Volunteering with Acupuncture,28-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/volunteering-with-acupuncture/,"Omer is a friendly, familiar face at our centre, one of our refugee friends who volunteers with our  activities for other refugees. One part of his volunteering work is helping with  Acupuncture sessions every Wednesday, when volunteers offer Acupuncture and relaxation sessions for refugee friends. Victoria sat down with him to talk about his experience volunteering. I first started volunteering in September 2022. JRS gave me a lot at a time when I was looking for shelter and food, and so it feels nice to give back to the community. Volunteering also shows me the bright side of things and it makes me feel very grateful for the support we’re able to give each other. Volunteering has taught me patience despite the obstacles we face. At JRS I meet people who have suffered a lot. Volunteering is an opportunity to help others and offer them a safe space; working with others, my suffering becomes nothing. At college I’m taking an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) class and as part of this I’m doing a presentation on my voluntary work at JRS. Most of my classmates are surprised by what they hear of the asylum system and have never heard of JRS or the work we do. They’ve all liked what I’ve shared about volunteering though, and are interested in volunteering themselves. It’s nice to represent JRS in this way. For many years I have had feelings of stiffness in my shoulders. Since I started receiving acupuncture therapy I have felt much better and the stiffness in my shoulders has decreased. Acupuncture therapy is also very helpful for breathing exercises and meditation. Overall, it’s a beneficial therapy for the alleviation of pain and stiffness without any side effects. Thanks, JRS for providing us with an opportunity for healing. Abdul I try to get involved in pretty much anything which bears the JRS logo! Officially, I’m a volunteer with the activities department. This involves setting up the spaces for our refugee activities, preparing and offering refreshments to visitors, and welcoming people as they arrive to the centre. I often find myself lending a listening ear to people who come in for appointments who want to have a chat – they might be sharing good news or bad news and need someone to sit and listen to them as they talk about what they are going through. I also take part in the activities themselves – activities such asCreate & Makeor Acupuncture. Acupuncture happens most weeks on a Wednesday. Twelve to fourteen friends take part every week, for 20-25 minutes at a time. If our acupuncturists see that the person is particularly relaxed they extend the acupuncture for five minutes, which improves the psychological benefits of the session. When acupuncture first started at JRS, some refugee friends were anxious at the sight of the needles! The acupuncturists who come down to the centre are great though – they are very helpful and friendly, and really reassure you before the session, and explain to you what’s going to happen. Everyone who has braved the first session is really keen about acupuncture. You can see that psychologically people feel relaxed and can enter a different headspace. Usually, people who have had acupuncture have a broad smile that lasts for days. I’ve tried acupuncture myself. It feels like a luxury treatment – after I’ve had it, I always feel really relaxed and reassured. I think it’s a great thing for JRS to offer as part of its activities programme. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,£10 to stay connected,28-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/10-to-stay-connected/,"From our centre in East London, we offer practical, legal, and casework support to refugees – who we come to know as our friends – as well as a safe space for people to come and have respite, learn new skills, and spend time in community. Our practical support aims to meet the needs of our refugee friends, who have No Recourse to Public Funds and are Appeals Rights Exhausted. Most are not entitled to government support. Those who come to see us are often struggling with homelessness or hunger. The main practical support we offer comes in the form of: During the pandemic, as much as we might not have liked doing everything online, most of us did not have to think twice about being able to get online to continue to work/study, order household items to our doorstep, or to keep in contact with loved ones. However, without support, the right to work, or to earn an income, refugee friends sometimes do not have enough money for phone credit and data. During lockdown, this meant increased levels of social isolation for some refugee friends who were unable to contact family and friends or emergency services. We therefore started providing £10 monthly phone top-ups, to make sure that much needed emotional and practical support could continue even when we could not physically meet in person. Though we have been back to in-person meetings for some time, we have continued to provide phone top-ups to refugee friends supported by JRS. The ban on the right to work continues to prohibit refugee friends from affording phone credit, which still remains essential in accessing services, keeping up to date with asylum cases, and learning new skills. One refugee friend, Omer, described how not having access to the internet affected his asylum claim: “Some libraries offer free internet and computer access, but often only for one hour a day and the connection can be slow. When my asylum application was rejected by the Home Office, I went to the library to submit all my documents to appeal the decision. The Home Office said they didn’t receive any of the documentation, but by this stage the library was closed. I missed the Home Office deadline.” Home Office deadlines are strict, and as Omer was unable to submit his paperwork on time, he was no longer eligible for accommodation and financial support from the Home Office as an asylum seeker. Without access to the internet, this was also a time of wider disconnection: “Before I registered with JRS, I moved around different places in the UK – I have experienced having no internet. I spent two months with no phone, and no access to the internet – two months of total isolation and disconnection from my family and friends.” Without internet, Omer found himself disconnected from everything – from the Home Office, from family and friends, from English classes, from legal advice, from his GP. Everything needs the internet. We try to give refugee friends the ability to stay connected on their own terms. Our phone credits are provided through the network of their choice, and refugee friends pick the phone plans that suit their connectivity needs. One refugee friend, Elz, told me that this was useful because it allows him to choose a suitable plan with both minutes (some of his appointments can only be arranged by phone, rather than by internet booking) and internet data. This flexibility means that refugee friends can use the phone credit across a wide range of services: “The phone top-ups are extremely good and very very helpful. It allows me to call my solicitor, the hospital, make appointments and have contact with different people. I also use the credit for internet data and attend English classes on zoom.” JRS Refugee Friend “The JRS mobile data top-ups are special for me – I don’t receive money from the Home Office, so I couldn’t buy any internet or any phone credit. It allows me to keep in touch with my family and my friends, and my solicitor. I use the JRS mobile top-up for internet data, mainly to access my college course, for doing my homework, for sending e-mails and booking essential appointments with the GP and the hospital.” Omer As simple as a phone top-up is, it makes navigating a complex asylum system that much easier. Refugee friends are able to keep in contact with friends and family, befrienders, and support services, all people who help and support our friends on their journey. A heartfelt thank you from all of us at JRS for your support. We could not offer this vital, much-needed support without you. “Hello there, thank you so much for the message.  Yes, I have just received the £10 credit on my phone. It is fantastic and very helpful…. A massive THANK YOU for your help and support. Please do keep safe and once again THANK YOU!!!” In addition to phone credit, refugee friends need access to good quality mobile phones. If you’re able to donate, please contact us atuk@jrs.net.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Why it’s important to observe World Day of Migrants and Refugees,19-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/why-its-important-to-observe-world-day-of-migrants-and-refugees/,"World Day of Migrants and Refugees is celebrated by the Church every year on the last Sunday of September. It is an opportunity for parishes and communities to learn more about refugees and migrants on the move, to pray for them, and work together for positive change. The theme of this year’s WDMR, which falls on Sunday 24thSeptember, is “Free to choose whether to migrate or to stay”.In his message, Pope Francis recognises and gives voice to an unfortunate reality of today’s world: that for many, migration is forced and involuntary. Poverty, persecution, war, and instability are amongst the many reasons why people are forced to leave their homes to search for safety and a better life. Pope Francis rightly reminds us that “eliminating these causes and thus putting an end to forced migration” will require a shared commitment by all. However, he is also aware that this will not be easy and will take a long time. Therefore, until we live in a world where all people have true freedom to choose whether to migrate or to stay, it is essential that we meet our responsibility to welcome and assist people who seek safety and refuge. It is not an easy time to be a refugee or asylum seeker in the UK. Asylum and immigration policies are becoming increasingly hostile, and people who come here seeking sanctuary are pushed to the margins, into destitution and vulnerability. TheIllegal Migration Act, passed in July this year, has all but extinguished the right to claim asylum in the UK. People are thus forced to make dangerous journeys to come to the UK, and often face punishment and hostility for the way they travelled here. Many asylum seekers are detained or forced into years of destitution. There is even growing hostility for those newly recognised as refugees, who are increasingly atrisk of homelessness. As a Church, we are called to act for collective justice. We should support work that brings peace and equality to migrants’ native countries, and when people come to us seeking sanctuary, we should treat them with dignity and respect. In Scripture we read countless stories of forced and involuntary migration – think of the stories of Abraham, Jacob, Joseph and Naomi, for example – and also countless tales of encounter and growth. In short, forced migration, and responding with welcome and hospitality to others, has been a part of our faith from the very beginning. Indeed, as a boy, Christ himself was a refugee. Today, we are called to see Christ in everyone who moves – but often we fail to do so. This is why marking WDMR as a community is important – though we should be living out hospitality every day, it can be useful to have an annual event to remind us of our commitment to welcome the stranger and respect the dignity of all human lives. Marking it – by talking to others, praying, holding a fundraiser, coordinating a welcome event – is also an act of witness to our neighbours. We see in those who move our sisters and brothers. We care. We want to, and we will, make a welcome. This year, we’ve worked with Caritas Westminster to produceresources for parishes and communities to use to observe World Day of Migrants and Refugees. The resource pack includes newsletter inserts, posters and bookmarks to raise awareness, and ideas for action and welcome. It’s been designed so that you can use the resources directly as they are, or adapt them to the unique needs, talents, and interests of your community. We’d love to hear from you and your community – how does your parish community welcome refugees and asylum seekers? Francis ends his Message, as usual, with a prayer, which itself closes with a plea for God’s help “to spread in hearts and in every situation the culture of encounter and of care.” Care and encounter are rightly closely bound up – if I love my neighbour, I will not walk by on the other side when they are in need. It is such a culture of encounter and care that we pray for, and strive to build at JRS – where we meet refugees as human persons, and serve them as companions. Thank you for your support, whatever form it comes in, whether that is prayers, donations, volunteering or writing to your MP. You are part of the JRS community, and we could not continue to do our work without you. While we wait for a world where everyone is truly “free to choose whether to migrate or to stay”, you are helping to make the world a little more liveable for those seeking sanctuary.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Two months and already feeling At Home…,18-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/two-months-and-already-feeling-at-home/,"Two months have passed since mid-July, and most mornings, I find myself crossing London to reach JRS’s offices, nestled in the charming neighbourhood of Wapping. I work alongside Amy-Leigh, who heads the Accommodation Project, but I also interact with knowledgeable colleagues from other departments, as well as the many refugee friends who visit our shop or participate in activities like art, gym, or English classes (the options are plentiful!).Once a week, I spend time with the women who are accommodated at Emilie House. Here, formal meetings, activities such as gardening, and (delicious) shared meals allow us to maintain the safe, peaceful, and welcoming environment that JRS aimed to create with this Housing Project opened in 2021. On other days, my schedule takes me to different parts of the city, where I meet with our wonderful volunteer hosts. I particularly cherish these visits because each home is unique, and all our hosts are different. Missionary priests who have travelled to all continents, dedicated nuns serving their communities, couples, and families eager to share their “good fortune” and daily lives with someone truly in need… distinct paths, but a common faith in humanity, a deep conviction that only solidarity can counter increasingly cruel policies, and, most of all, a profound generosity.  “(Hosting) it’s based for me on the idea that I’m a very, very lucky person …with my life and with the things I have (so) it’s just simply about wanting to share that and I think that’s against the backdrop of the hostile environment and the terrible things we see on the news every day about how refugees are treated, there’s a sense of Injustice. So, what we do is insignificant in response to that, but it feels like at least we’re doing something to address it.” JRS UK At Home Hosts Indeed, it takes incredible generosity to welcome a stranger into one’s intimacy. It means sharing the kitchen, sometimes the bathroom, wondering if they’ve returned safely, being aware that you can no longer act as if you were perfectly alone or with your closest loved ones. Yet, as you listen to our hosts recount their experiences, you realize it is also quite simple. It is about opening a door, establishing basic rules for living together… and letting yourself being guided by the experienced JRS team.  “When we’ve hosted in the past, it’s been great but it’s a lot of responsibility. Working with JRS takes a huge amount of the strain out of the experience and makes it much more enjoyable and relaxed.” JRS UK At Home Hosts Every placement is unique. What sets JRS Hosting Scheme apart is our meticulous preparation, our commitment to finding the perfect “match,” and the ongoing support we provide throughout the entire process.  “We were attracted to JRS because it’s quite a grassroot organization. It is small and it feels more like a family, everyone seems to really care about the welfare of the refugee friends and I think that was really important to us.” JRS UK At Home Hosts At Homeis the perfect illustration of our mission to put the person at the centre of our work and to “be with”, which resonated so much with me when I applied for the job. Being part of its expansion is now one of the many reasons I feel blessed to have been hired. Learn more about JRS UK’s At Home Hosting Scheme Laurence RossignolisAccommodation Officerat JRS UK.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,“To escape from our tumultuous lives and spend some time with Mother Nature”,05-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/to-escape-from-our-tumultuous-lives-and-spend-some-time-with-mother-nature/,"Last week we visited Kew Gardens and Kew Palace with 21 refugee friends and 5 JRS staff and volunteers through the Historic Royal Palaces Community Access Scheme. It was a wonderful day of being awe-inspired by nature whilst sharing laughter, conversation, and memories together. Many of our friends had never visited the Gardens before and enjoyed seeing the huge plants in the conservatories, particularly the African plants! There was a mixture of calm and relief along with joy and wonder as friends explored the Gardens and spent time discussing all the shapes, sizes and colours of the plants. It was great for our friends and their wellbeing to physically be in and explore a new place whilst being surrounded by and receiving respite from nature. These moments are all too rare for our friends who are constantly dealing with the stresses of the Hostile Environment and daily challenges of destitution. The day will be remembered by the smiles on friends’ faces. Here are some of the photos and quotes from our friends about the visit and how they will remember the day:  Thanks, JRS, once again for providing us with an opportunity to visit the historical Kew Botanical Gardens.To escape from our tumultuous lives and spend some time with Mother Nature.It was an amazing experience to see the most diverse collection of living plants and to observe history at the former summer retreat Palace of King George III.We found solace in walking around floral displays and themed gardens.Felt amazed at the Palm House to observe the echo system of exotic rainforests and experience different climate zones at the Princess of Wales Conservatory. Giant lily pads at the Waterlily House are also fascinating.At the end of our tour, we visited the former summer residence of King George III. At that point, I felt that somebody propelled me into the 18th century with a time machine because almost everything was kept in its natural form.It was a wonderful experience to see, observe, and learn many things in one day!Thank you very much, JRS, for arranging this event!   I had a fantastic moment in Kew gardens with wonderful people. Thank you JRS!  I really enjoyed myself and I a had a good time at Kew Gardens! Thank you guys for the trip!  I enjoy the garden – I send the picture of the garden to my friend at home they like it that God is wonderful for all those thing that exists in that Country like back home! Please take us to the place next year! Thank you!  Yes, it was a very nice experience. I enjoyed it. Thank you.  Thanks for all people with us in JRS it was nice picnic!  I hope next to another place! Thanks very much to all.  Thank you to the Historic Royal Palaces for letting this happen through their Community Access Scheme.   [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Countering the hostile environment through hospitality,05-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/countering-the-hostile-environment-through-hospitality/,"“We live in a world of stark difference, of richness and poverty. Often at the table it comes across that we are countering the hostile environment through hospitality.” James Conway SJ, one of ourAt Homehosts Finding regular, safe, and secure accommodation is one of the greatest challenges faced by destitute refugees – our refugee friends. TheIllegal Migration Actpassed in July 2023 practically extinguishes the right to claim asylum in the UK, inevitably leading to thousands of individuals who have a well-founded fear of persecution having their asylum claim refused. Whilst families are generally entitled to statutory support regardless of their immigration status, the majority of those whose asylum claims are refused lose their right to claim any benefits or accommodation. They are banned from working and become utterly destitute, left powerless after having already spent months or years awaiting a decision. To make matters worse, the Home Office has recently shared a statement confirming that it will be following a stricter interpretation of their current policy of ending asylum support. Now, refugee friends are at risk of being given less than 21 days notice to find alternative accommodation. Across the sector, we are already seeing huge increases in referrals for urgent accommodation. Additionally, the Home Office’s long term failure to progress asylum claims has made it financially unsustainable for many solicitors to operate within the asylum Legal Aid framework. This means that it is taking even longer for those refused asylum to find new legal representation, to make a ‘fresh claim’, and settle in the UK. These changes will undoubtedly lead to a huge increase of vulnerable people becoming trapped in limbo; cycling between homelessness, precarious conditions, and even detention.  Hosts Steve and Gill visit the JRS centre in Wapping Fortunately, we already have a well-developed model that responds to this growing need for safe and stable accommodation. The At Home hosting scheme provides respite to refugee friends experiencing destitution, and creates a safe, hospitable sanctuary where they feel welcome again. At a time when we are seeing more hostility than ever, hosting is a life-line for refugee friends at risk of street homelessness. Please get in touch if you are interested in finding more about our scheme. You would be more than welcome to come visit us at the JRS centre, like our wonderful hosts, Steve and Gill. We accept applications to host from anyone living in London who is willing to open up their home to a destitute refugee.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,“It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness”,22-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/it-is-better-to-light-a-candle-than-to-curse-the-darkness/,"I didn’t want to leave Syria, I didn’t want to be a refugee. But there was no other way to survive. I claimed asylum on arrival in the UK and I found myself in detention in Penally Camp in Wales. It was a massive site with Nissan hut-style dormitories, where new arrivals struggled to find the showers or dining room, or even the office of the sub-contractors – as it carried no signage. Seeing the confusion of the newly arrived, I had to help them, simple things like how to get Wi-Fi, how to replenish their medicines, and simply answering people’s questions. There was so much need that it led me to think of devising a better system of communication, so I organised Whatsapp groups, each one of a certain number and each with leaders who would be responsible for their group and the groups in turn would help each other. We arranged these according to language groups and other criteria. It soon became clear that people from the local community were interested in helping us, I found them on social media and joined various groups. So now we had a connection with the outside and they wanted to meet us. However, some far-right protesters were always at the gate, so we couldn’t meet there, but we could meet elsewhere locally. The supporters asked to be added to our Whatsapp network so they joined different groups and offered a lot of help. They helped us in many ways, with food, medicines and English classes. The genesis of a Union All of this was growing fast, so I eventually called my solicitor and asked him if, as an asylum seeker, I had a right to form an association. He wanted to know why and I explained that I wanted to campaign for better conditions and the improvement of the wellbeing of the people inside Penally camp My solicitor said I needed a Constitution and signatories. I wrote the Constitution and emailed it to the welfare office inside the camp, asking them to print 10 copies, give me a pen and a stapler – I didn’t have anything, and they gave me all of this. Some of the residents signed, and I informed the welfare office that we had established an Association with a Constitution to help the residents. We were called “Camp Residents of Penally: CROP”. We decided in our first meeting to prioritise English classes, some activities outside the camp and some art workshops. We asked the Office if we could have a teacher from outside to come and teach in the camp, this they refused. We therefore found the residents who had the best command of English and asked them to lead the classes, one was even an English teacher by profession. The office gave us some books and stationery and 53 people immediately signed up for the classes. We had three teachers so needed three rooms. We found rooms in the camp and asked the contractors to allow us to use them, they refused, but we insisted, and eventually they gave us the keys. We would be responsible for ourselves, so we kept a register and started the classes. People were so happy to be able to do this, it gave them a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Kind local volunteers gave us three laptops, English books and stationery. Further initiatives Sadly, there was a daily presence of protesters at the gate, which meant that people were not leaving the camp, which made it even more like a prison. One day, I met a journalist from the Tenby Observer and they offered us more support. They linked me with a local artist called Anna Waters, who wanted to help asylum seekers. Anna gave us both materials and workshops. This was announced on our Whatsapp groups and delivered over Zoom in the classrooms. The outcome for the men in Penally was excellent and the feedback from the artist was very good, she really felt the engagement of the men. It was great to have 3 English classes 5 days a week and 3 art workshops per week. As CROP, we discussed how we could further help the men to get out of the camp and find them some voluntary work to do, as of course they are barred from working in the UK. The local community offered us volunteering opportunities in their shops and businesses. We could help on farms with milking cows and other tasks. The Charity shops in local towns offered us the opportunity to volunteer there, to which the camp’s management once again said ‘No’. After many meetings and negotiation we reached an agreement; I would give a list of 15 names the day before and these men were allowed to leave the camp early – up until then, we could not leave the camp before 11.00.The Public Law Projecthelped me to campaign to have access to the camp at any time of day, which we successfully achieved. We also linked withCity of Sanctuary,who offered us walks and days out, to do something fun, to get the men out of the camp. They rented a van or bus and took 15 people every time. Our first activity was a Pizza Night, after which we shared photos on the Whatsapp group which encouraged everyone to join in. We had to make a schedule because it was so successful. In general, we had volunteer or Sanctuary days 2-3 days a week, with a bus twice a day. This was very helpful to engage with local people and allow them to get to know the refugees. It really helped the asylum seekers to improve their mood and to have hope. Buddy matching Another initiative we promoted was to recommend people from within the camp to have a Buddy from outside. We knew this would be helpful for everyone, matching people from the wider local community in Wales. The Buddies were found by our supporters in the local Whatsapp groups and we matched up the people. We clarified that this would be a friend, a supporter, and the communication would be over Whatsapp. We managed expectations so that If they were to meet in person for a coffee, it was clear that this was not a date! The programme went very well for everyone concerned. Continuity Compared to others I received settled status very quickly and was able to work and get a job immediately. But I couldn’t forget my brothers who were held in Detention. We retained CROP in action with other responsible people inside the camp in charge of it. All the activities that we’d done had always been led by a member of CROP. I continued to campaign on behalf of the refugees and I communicated with MPs, from the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. Also with the All Party Parliamentary Group for Detention and for Immigration[1]. I also worked with David Bolt, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, which covered prisons and detention centres. We arranged Zoom meetings between him and the refugees and he visited Penally. He released the report which led to the eventual closure of Penally Camp. We explored alternative ways to accommodate refugees instead of in military camps. We worked with‘Refugees at Home’charity and in fact I joined the scheme and was able to live with a family through that charity. Penally camp closed in March 2021. We decided to continue the work of CROP which had been run and funded entirely by asylum seekers and had helped many people. We became a registered charity“Life Seekers Aid”in 2021 and have organised exhibitions in Wales and London to make the plight of asylum seekers known. We run community hubs and have been active in Napier Barracks and other centres since. Napier Barracks remains open to this day. We still have plenty of work to do!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"My experience at JRS was nothing short of amazing, invaluable, and extremely eye opening.",22-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/my-experience-at-jrs-was-nothing-short-of-amazing-invaluable-and-extremely-eye-opening/,"I was given the position ofvolunteer detention officerin the Detention Outreach team for my (almost) two months at JRS this summer. It was the most enriching experience I could have asked for as a 20-year-old student. The two months were packed with knowledge of the immigration and asylum law system in the UK, human experiences of those going through the process and how charity work fits into it all. As a law student, the experience taught me as much – or even more- than a law module at university. The team welcomed my questions and taught me all about the background and basic knowledge that I was lacking. Never had I expected, in such a short amount of time, to feel part of the family which is JRS. Not only did they care about me and how I was doing in my experience, but they cared about each other and most importantly they cared about the people that they worked with and for: the cases and the clients were part of the family. I was present when refugees received their positive asylum decisions back as well as when the detention team were informed that people at the detention centre were being released. It made everyone’s day and it was clear that every little win helped. The theme of social justice united everyone. My experience was made up of working on cases which were picked up in Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs). JRS was a forum of communication for these detained people who knew nothing about the system they were in, we supported, and we explained. Most of those held in IRCs were refugees, victims of human trafficking, or simply foreign criminals. All completely different from completely different places but in common they had the fact that they were given no resources and kept in inhumane prisons for sometimes simply not having the right documentation. The most shocking thing for me was that a simple theft conviction -having EUSS settlement, or a visa- means when deported they have a 20-year ban on the UK. It was eye opening to see how countries use immigration detention as a prison system; they provide no resources and instead, the huge firms which run them profit from having people inside, moving them around from centre to centre, providing jobs for transport companies for example. They have created a money machine, whilst those inside are at the verge of suicide. Seeing this as someone that has not had contact with the asylum system in the UK was astonishing and mind boggling. I have been shaped in ways which I did not think were possible. I am now more driven as I understand that passion does drive social justice work, and my eyes have been expanded to pick up so many troubling details present in the law and immigration systems. Thank you JRS! [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,From the Himalayas to Wapping with love,14-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/from-the-himalayas-to-wapping-with-love/,"I was born at the edge of the Himalayas. Our house was encompassed by a vast forest. Until the age of 10, I used to wander through vast forest of maize and corn fields and flowing streams. Those distant memories keep connecting me to nature and the environment. During the summer in the UK, I spent most of my spare time in Parks. So when Mark from JRS asked me to participate in a program to preserve the local area, I accepted this offer.  The volunteers of this project greeted me with a warm welcome and we began picking litter at the local park and kept going through the waterways, streets,  parking bays, ponds, and housing estates.  At the end of the event, all volunteers gathered at the Wapping Green and we had a wonderful chat about almost everything. I truly enjoyed that experience for the conservation of nature and looking forward to further participating in these venues! I also want to say thank you very much JRS for providing me with this opportunity to connect volunteers from the local community. Thank you to Abdul for sharing his reflections with us!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Creating community with the help of volunteers,08-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/creating-community-with-the-help-of-volunteers/,"Our activities at Emilie House are a relaxed and fulfilling way for residents to come together regularly as a community. They are an excellent tool for community connection, and increasingly, an opportunity to unveil talent and spark innovation as new skills are learnt. Emilie House activities have always been connected to life at home. Through the textiles project, a range of beautiful decorative pieces have been created and scattered across the home. Sarah, our Textiles Volunteer, shares her reflections on our most recent project: ‘Home’.  Can you tell us a bit about your work and how you came to volunteer with JRS? What inspired you? I have always worked as designer and maker from my studio in London collaborating with interior designers, film costume designers and the furnishing textile industry on various projects over 35 years. I specialise in machine and hand embroidery, printing, dyeing and appliqué. A love of textiles and the creative process of actually making are central to my work. My volunteering for JRS is a lucky case of right time, right place. The advert for a textile volunteer on Instagram was brought to my attention by someone who works for the Jesuits in Britain.  What has the experience of volunteering with JRS been like for you? Have you learnt anything? How has it impacted your own life? I approached the application and role with little confidence having no experience of formal teaching and minimal participation of work with community groups. My hope was that the group of refugee friends would experience the same joy of craft making, creativity and achievement that I have enjoyed throughout my career. Leading the textile group for refugee friends is an absolute joy. I have learnt so much about working with vulnerable people, met a group of amazing individuals who I would never encounter in regular life. By being reliable, supplying materials, trying to remember requested materials or solving problems each week, I hoped to build up trust, a sense of belonging, of achievement from learning new skills and finishing a project, enjoy comradery working as a group and to add a little bit of enjoyable structure to their lives. I have learnt so much about the group of migrants, asylum seekers, refugees that we hear about in the news. Over the year my relationship with the group and the individuals has become more relaxed and open within the understood boundaries. I hope that they trust me and enjoy my company as an acquaintance.  Being thanked at the end of each session by refugee friends who have such difficult lives feels so unnecessary – I enjoy the sessions.  Can you describe the recent textiles project? What was the process? Any highlights? Amy-Leigh, the Accommodation Project Co-ordinator, and I worked together to structure a 6-week project – each resident of Emilie House to complete an A4-sized textile piece to be framed and hung in Emilie House. The subject was ‘Home’. We asked refugee friends what the ‘home’ meant to them and to draw out ideas. We transferred the drawings to fabric and then they embroidered the elements using the skills they had learnt throughout the year. Within the subject they had artistic and creative freedom. I learnt a lot from the images they chose to portray. The highlight for me was the final session: we had scheduled the sixth session for framing and hanging. During the fifth week all the refugee friends worked independently to finish their pieces – I was so overjoyed and gratified by their commitment, by the obvious sense of joy and achievement when we hung the pictures together in the final session, contributing to life in Emilie House now and in the future.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,“A day like that makes us think of something else”,07-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/a-day-like-that-makes-us-think-of-something-else/,"On the morning of 26thJuly, delightful aromas wafted from the kitchen of Emilie House. The residents of Emilie House had risen at dawn to start cooking, tidy up, and decorate the garden. The excitement was palpable as the residents looked forward to welcoming and offering hospitality to friends, volunteers, and JRS staff: the annual Emilie House Garden Party was about to begin. When all the guestshad arrived, our newest resident lead the guests in a game of Party Bingo in the garden, beautifully maintained by volunteers and residents of the house. The game encouraged everyone to stand up, greet each other, and exchange amusing questions about linguistic talents, dancing abilities, and when people were born (thankfully, just the month, not the year!). Two former residents of Emilie House joined us, saying:“I like this house, I miss it, the gardening and JRS people too!”    After the game, we tucked into our buffet lunch. Everyone enjoyed the diverse and delicious dishes prepared by the residents –  not to mention the refreshing mint lemonade, perfect for the beautiful summer day. It was a medley of a medley of Pakistani vegetable Pakora, Ethiopian Shiro Wat (chickpea stew) and Injera (sour fermented flatbread), Nigerian Jollof rice and plantains, spicy chicken and fresh salads.  We also celebrated with an Ethiopian coffee ceremony. This cultural ritual plays a central role in Ethiopian social life and is not just about drinking coffee but also about fostering a sense of community and hospitality. It has now become a tradition at Emilie House and was particularly fitting for the occasion. One of the first residents of the house proudly presided over the ceremony, skilfully roasting and grinding the coffee beans, brewing and serving the coffee before finally pouring it from a height into tiny cups to create a bubbly foam on top.  She took the opportunity to warmly thank the guests, especially the Holy Family of St Emilie and JRS.   Fr Michael Holman SJ, chair of JRS UK’s Management Committee, was with us and also gave thanks for the Sisters’ generosity, recognising that Emilie House is “a project that really makes a difference, in an accountable way that really witnesses the Gospel of Jesus.” Sister Irena, speaking on behalf of the Holy Family of St Emilie, praised the residents for the delicious food and shared her“sense of belonging.” The residents could not agree more.One resident said, of the sisters:“I am really, really, really… happy! The sisters are very lovely, sweet people.”  Days like these speak to the importance of having time to come together in community and celebration. In the words of one Emilie House resident:“It was good to be cooking and talking all together because we are always too busy. We have so much stress, not only because of our documents… a day like that makes us think of something else.”Emilie House is a fantastic project, offering refugee friends a safe space to stay – one where they can form community and have agency over how they live. In Emilie House, residents can use the space freely, cook when they like, offer hospitality – an important part of many cultures – to others. When Emilie House was officially opened two years ago, one of the first refugee friends to move in said to us:“I hope that JRS can get other more houses to help more people in the future”. The good news is that this will soon be a reality. Emilie House is a “model” to a new house that, with the support of the Jesuits of Britain and other generous Catholic partners, will offer a similar safe and welcoming temporary home we can offer to male refugee friends. Hopefully, next year, we will be able to report not one but two garden parties…  Faces have been blurred to protect anonymity. Our wonderful accommodation team also run JRS UK’s At Home hosting scheme. At present our hosting scheme is inurgent need of more hosts.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,A twentieth century inspiration – St Alberto Hurtado,07-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/a-twentieth-century-inspiration-st-alberto-hurtado/,"Hanging on the wall where I work at Jesuit Refugee Service in Wapping is a picture which I am very fond of. Reproduced here, it is a picture of Saint Alberto Hurtado. Alberto Hurtado He is a twentieth century saint who died of cancer in 1952 at the age of 52. Before he joined the Jesuits, Alberto was a lawyer – which would later prove useful in his work for the poor people of Santiago in Chile. Early during his time as a Jesuit priest, he spent much of his time working for the Catholic Church, working especially with students, giving retreats and teaching. He found time to write a book on Chile as a Catholic Country. All this seems fairly routine for a Jesuit priest. But in 1944 he began to encourage other people to join him in working for the poor in Santiago, especially the numerous homeless children who were roaming the streets there. This work developed until he could provide not just food and shelter but a welcoming home-like place for the children to go to. He called this ‘Hogar de Cristo’– ‘The Home of Christ’. At JRS we have a similar idea –the ‘At Home’ hosting scheme– where destitute and homeless asylum-seekers are offered a time to stay with someone for four months – providing a home, at least for a while, and not just overnight emergency accommodation. Alberto’s work later expanded to provide homes for men and women, including facilities for training and rehabilitation. “I had quite a big house for just myself, with spare rooms—for just me, you know? So, I couldn’t say no. The Lord was looking down on me, saying ‘what about those spare rooms?’ I am pleased I did it.” At present our hosting scheme is inurgent need of more hosts. Hosting a refugee friend is a powerful way of living a true ‘culture of encounter’ and putting social justice into action. Could you host? Learn more about the At Home hosting scheme Our work at JRS echoes Alberto’s life in other ways. Saint Alberto qualified as a lawyer and was heavily involved in labour movements in Chile. Today, our Legal Project provides assistance in negotiating the complex obstacle-course which the Home Office places in the way of refugees seeking official recognition of their need for asylum – of their need for a place of safety from violence and persecution. “Without access to free legal representation, access to justice is restricted to those who can pay for it. Where access to justice is not universal it ceases to be justice…” Michael, Senior Policy Officer, explains the need for increased legal support and why legal aid is essential. Read more A refugee friend’s experience of the Legal Project Saint Alberto is an inspiration for many of us who work at the Jesuit Refugee Service. Our office is in a building called the Hurtado Centre. I hope he watches with approval from his picture in the main hall where we welcome hundreds of refugee friends each month. Like ‘The Home of Christ’, there’s a cup of tea or coffee and a snack; refugee friends can sit and chat or just rest for a while. We try to make it a welcoming home-like place to come to. While refugee friends are in the centre, they can pick up some food, maybe some clothing, take part in activities, or meet others over a hot meal at our fortnightly Social Drop-In. In the lower corner of the portrait of Saint Alberto Hurtado which hangs in our centre is a picture of a green pick-up truck. Alberto Hurtado’s green pick-up truck On most days, Alberto Hurtado would drive around Santiago in this green pick-up truck to bring destitute children to ‘The Home of Christ’ for food and shelter.  It’s an inspiration to all of us who work with Jesuit Refugee Service in the Hurtado Centre in Wapping to provide welcome, care and support to the many refugees and asylum seekers who find their way to our country. His ability to inspire others to social action encourages us to keep reaching out and talking to others about what is going on in the UK and the social change we need. He brought together intellectual reflections on the church with real action for change. Saint Alberto would be a good patron-saint for Jesuit Refugee Service. Committed to providing help to destitute people combined with a warm welcome, he would be a good pick for a patron saint. But he won’t be – JRS was founded by another Jesuit, Fr Pedro Arrupe and we are hoping he will be made a saint quite soon, and would become the patron of JRS. Nevertheless, Saint Alberto inspires us, and for his intercession in our work we are always grateful. Fr Mike Smith SJ is part of the St Ignatius community in Stamford Hill. He works with JRS three days a week, running the JRS Shop and offering a welcome to refugee friends who come to the centre.  [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,St Ignatius of Loyola – a friend for all seasons; a universal friend,25-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/st-ignatius-of-loyola-a-friend-for-all-seasons-a-universal-friend/,"Step inside the Hurtado Centre in Wapping (the JRS UK office) and you experience peace, a total loving acceptance. You are welcomed as a friend amongst friends from all over the world. The centre is always busy – refugee friends meet staff for destitution and legal assistance, pick up essential items from the JRS Shop, and take part in activities such as ESOL or acupuncture or community kitchen. Undergirding all this activity runs a spirit of joy, friendship and dedication. To mark the feast day of St Ignatius (31stJuly),  I’d like to trace this river of friendship to its source: to a 16thcentury Spanish soldier. Life changed for Ignatius, born in 1491 in Northern Spain, when he was wounded in the Battle of Pamplona and forced to accept a long convalescence. The only two books available in his months of solitude were the Life of Christ and the Lives of the Saints. Ignatius was intrigued by the deep inner peace the reading of these books brought and contrasted it with the restless excitement he experienced when formerly reading tales of courtly love. But there was no sudden reformation of Ignatius the soldier to Ignatius the Saint. Months of prayer and pilgrimages, years of study and education followed his physical healing and – perhaps what St Ignatius is most famous for – the Spiritual Exercises. Because he offered his Spiritual Exercises to men and to women from different backgrounds, different countries, different walks of life, I see Ignatius first and foremost asa universal Friend. “I call you friends”, said Jesus on the night before he died, “because I have made known to you everything I have learnt from my Father. Three days later, risen from the dead, Jesus went a step further:  He “breathed on them and said, “Receive theHoly Spirit.”  His friends were filled with Jesus’ very self, with His Spirit of Love and Truth. The Spiritual Exercises that Ignatius offers make known to his friends everything he learnt from the Holy Spirit. So we’re invited to build our lives on this rock of truth and love, and to be “people for others”. For most people life is hard. The way ahead is not obvious. We have no “Sat-nav” equivalent to keep us from travelling in a wrong direction. Sometimes we even question the very purpose of our lives. Ignatius shares with us the rock-solid Foundation he had learnt through prayer: “The human person is created to praise, reverence and serve God our Lord and by so doing save his or her soul.”This light brings joy. On that foundation, Ignatius introduces his friends and followers to the reality of the spiritual battleground against which all daily life is played, and to the workings of our own spirit. We are invited to respond to the call of Christ, to keep Him company as He daily continues to “set all afire with love.” And so we discover the source of the friendship and joy that refreshes each one in the Hurtado Centre, Wapping. Ignatian Spirituality is rooted in community, and this informs the approach at JRS. We walk humbly alongside people who have had to flee, but we learn so much more than just that story – we learn about each others’ likes and dislikes, our hopes and dreams. The Hurtado Centre is a space of encounter, mutual relationship, and community. Everyone is greeted as a friend. Here at JRS the word friendship evokes images and sounds of friends embracing and celebrating when they find out that someone’s children received scholarships to carry on studying at higher education; the familiar smiles on the faces when we greet each other as people arrive to the building; the shared anger and injustice when discussing the Home Office, and the laughter when someone scores an own goal followed by cheers of support and encouragement. These shared moments bring us closer together in friendship and stronger together in hope. Thank you, St Ignatius, for this legacy of friendship.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Solidarity and encounter in the face of the Illegal Migration Act,24-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/solidarity-and-encounter-in-the-face-of-the-illegal-migration-act/,"The so-called Illegal Migration – that is, Refugee Ban – Act is now law. This is horrifying and enraging. It all but extinguishes the right to claim asylum in the UK; it will mean a huge expansion of detention, and allow the indefinite incarceration of children on a massive scale; survivors of human trafficking will be stripped of all protection and support, undoing the hard won and incremental progress made on this issue over the last decade; and ultimately, hundreds of thousands will be trapped in limbo indefinitely, cycling between destitution, detention, and semi-incarceration in quasi-detention spaces like Napier barracks. Attempts by the Lords toamendthe Bill and ameliorate its worst effects were defeated last week, as the Bill was rammed through the final stages of the parliamentary process. There was significant pressure from some Tory backbenchers in the Commons to retain some safeguards on the detention of unaccompanied children. The government’s response wasreportedby some media as a meaningful concession, but the alteration they made to their original drafting of the Bill is so insipid as to offer very little protection. In fact, the government has thatonlyunaccompaniedchildren, who are detained specifically for removal, canapply to a courtfor a bail after 8 days, rather than 28. This won’t apply to children in families, even if they’re infants. It won’t apply to children on their own detained while the government tries to decide what to do with them – as those in Manston were. And to make use of the provision, a lone child needs a lawyer. Those are hard to come by, especially if you can’t advocate for yourself. Until this Bill passed, anyone detained could apply to a court for bail immediately. This was just a normal part of ensuring the system was operating lawfully. So, the small number of children this provision applies to, in very particular circumstances, will have fewer protections against immigration detention thananyonedoes now. Hardly a safeguard. This law is purely destructive. It is intentionally, gratuitously cruel. It makes it impossible for most refugees to claim asylum. In this, it destroys mechanisms and principles designed to protect human life in the context of forced displacement, forged after the Holocaust. The devastating moral and human implications are hard to overstate. The Act also has no constructive purpose. It will not even achieve its stated aim of ‘stopping the boats’, and it is a traffickers’ dream, making it impossible for vulnerable people to go to the authorities for help and leaving them so desperate that they have to accept a roof over their heads, a hot meal, or a few pounds on whatever terms are available. This must be bad for society as a whole. But the government has been so determined to demonstrate its cruelty towards refugees that this has been considered a price worth paying. The politics that birthed this evil piece of legislation seeks to divide us. It seeks to dehumanise those who are ‘other’. It militates against a culture of encounter. But we will not let it do these things. JRS UK will continue to oppose this despicable piece of legislation and call for it to be repealed. And we will continue to stand in solidarity with refugees. As they are pushed further to the margins, detained, rendered destitute, denied sanctuary, we will continue to accompany and serve them as companions. We will be there. And what about right now? Over the next few months, as MPs are in recess, the immediate back and forth of parliamentary processes is in a lull. This is time to reflect, to regroup, to plan. It is also time to reach out to communities, to seek to foster regular encounter and understanding wherever possible. There are so manysimple stepswe can take that can make the world better, that can help, slowly, to forge a better way forward. Have a conversation with your neighbour about refugees; listen to, and really seek to understand, someone you disagree with; and reach out to whoever, in your community, is deemed the other. Thank you for walking with JRS. Now is not the time to give up – JRS will continue to accompany, serve, and advocate alongside and for refugee friends. Now more than ever, we need your help and support to do this. Donate Today [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,A reflection on the new JRS UK football team,18-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/a-reflection-on-the-new-jrs-uk-football-team/,"On Saturday 15 July at the fourth ever ‘London Unity Cup’ in Camden Town, the JRS UK football team was born! We had been invited to put up a team for a small football tournament for refugees and we had no problem recruiting enough players to represent JRS. There were eight teams in all and some looked very well prepared, fit and able. The teams were split into two groups of four, with matches lasting 20 minutes, with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the semi-finals. It was also a day for bringing people together, meeting other similar charities to us and encouraging all who took part to have a good time. We were up for the first match of the tournament just as the sun came out from behind the clouds to light up the Castlehaven sports pitches, our Wembley stadium for the day. Our opponents were called ‘Legends FC’ and our squad was made up of Karim (in goal), Mark, Muhydeen, Omer, Moussa, Eyad and our superb captain, Fernand. Within a few minutes of the game starting, we found ourselves one nil down and I was beginning to worry this could be a long day. However, within no time we were level and playing well and after scoring goals either side of half-time we ran out 5-3 winners. I have played and watched football all my life and this was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had. I wasn’t even playing but just living out my fantasy of being a footballing mastermind. As we enjoyed a rest all talk was on what we needed to do to secure a semi-final spot. Surely one win from our remaining two games would do the job. We started game 2 against ‘Forest United Green’ with much more confidence but soon found ourselves 4-1 down after a lack-lustre first half. I didn’t give the team the ‘hairdryer’ treatment at half-time, but I must have said something right because with a couple of minutes to go in the second half we had got back to 4-3 and were looking for the equaliser. Time was not on our side, and we lost but our journey felt far from over. The less said about game 3 the better, we were on the wrong end of an eleven-goal thriller against ‘Dost A’ and our tournament was over. One of our best players had to leave before the start and Fernand, our player of the tournament, went off with a foot injury in the first half. Dost, a centre for young refugees and migrants, had two teams, one of which won the tournament in the end. It wasn’t meant to be, but it really didn’t matter. We had played with such joy and were easily the best supported team in the competition. The sight of Karim, our goalkeeper, bravely and skilfully keeping a number of shots out of our net will live long in my memory. The day represented all that is good about football with sportsmanship at a premium at the ‘London Unity Cup’. Great credit is due to Gloria Ho, the former Destitution Services Manager at the Hackney Red Cross Centre, who started the tournament pre-COVID with a group of friends in the hope that it might lead to more future events and greater integration between the refugee/asylum seeking communities and local communities. I must also say a big thank-you to Dallya for organising our team and Mark for demonstrating yet another of his many talents out on the pitch. The biggest thank-you must go to the rest of our players and I know our friends who played enjoyed the day very much. Who knows, the trophy cabinet may not stay empty for too long. Everyone who took part can be very proud of the contribution JRS made to this excellent competition. It was a day full of joy and laughter and we WERE a GREAT team. I hope we have many more days like this, the ‘beautiful game’ can now take its rightful place in a wonderful array of activities we run for our refugee friends. Aidan is the Deputy Director (Operations) at JRS UK, and head coach of our new football team! [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,My job helps me appreciate the things we often take for granted’,11-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/my-job-helps-me-appreciate-the-things-we-often-take-for-granted/,"Challenging, difficult, rewarding… just some of the adjectives Stephanie uses to describe her work as a Destitution Caseworker at JRS. She says her job helps her appreciate the things we often take for granted—a safe place to sleep for the night, access to secondary healthcare, the right to work, to name a few. The Destitution Team are the first port of call for people who come to JRS for help. Everyone is welcomed as they are. Everybody’s needs are both different yet similar in many aspects. Connecting up The team take a holistic approach as they listen to each person, looking at different areas of their life. A graduate in International Relations and with experience at the frontline working with people in need, Stephanie admits that even as a Brit, navigating the asylum support system is tricky. JRS supports eligible refugee friends through this system, empowering them to access the support they need and sometimes advocating on their behalf. When refugee friends aren’t eligible for asylum support, a huge issue is homelessness. As such, a lot of time is spent linking up refugee friends withJRS’ At Home hosting schemeas well as other hosting charities and shelters. Other areas of connection can be made to healthcare, community activities and signposting to other specialist organisations. TheHardship grants of £15 every two weeks, as well as one-off grants in emergencies provide much needed relief, as do the food and toiletries that are regularly available. Help and advice from the legal project can also be life-changing, and this is always given with the wrap-around practical destitution support. JRS is also blessed to be able to provide befriending, where volunteers call refugee friends every week to provide additional emotional support. This greatly contributes to well-being. Other activities such as creative writing workshops help people find coping strategies and an internal strength to begin their healing process post-trauma without having to relive experiences. Sometimes, we are limited in what we can practically do as the needs are so great, but a core aspect of JRS’s mission and work isaccompaniment.This involves taking time, sitting with refugee friends, helping them understand the available options to make informed decisions. Psychologists say that the impact of trauma is lessened by not going through it alone. So even if certain problems can’t be solved, then simply the ‘being with’ is helpful, and the emotional support of knowing that they are not alone. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"As it heads back to the House of Commons, what’s the state of the Illegal Migration – Refugee Ban – Bill?",07-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/as-it-heads-back-to-the-house-of-commons-whats-the-state-of-the-illegal-migration-refugee-ban-bill/,"Sophie Cartwright, JRS Senior Policy Officer, writes with an update on the Illegal Migration Bill and what you can do stand in solidarity with refugees, and call on the Refugee Ban Bill to be struck down. The Illegal Migration Bill, which would all but extinguish the right to claim asylum in the UK, has now completed report stage in the House of Lords, and is about to return to the Commons next week. The government has been defeated in the Lords on a number of fronts, meaning that the Bill going back to the Commons looks very different from the one that left it.There is a very great danger that the government, will simply reject the changes made. The Bill is due to have its third reading in the House of Lords on Monday 10thJuly, and head straight back to the House of Commons on Tuesday 11thJuly. This speedy timetable is unprecedented – there is normally a gap between the Lords and return to the Commons, allowing the Commons to consider amendments carefully and give clear reasons where they don’t accept them. This lack of scrutiny isn’t what we’d have wanted – but there isstill timeto influence the outcome. The Bill seeks to make all claims for asylum ‘inadmissible’, and would give a statutory duty to immediately remove people seeking sanctuary from the country. This is possibly one of the most impractical – and deeply cruel – notions of the whole Bill as in reality it is complex to remove and deport people from the country. In reality, we would see people in need of international protection subjected to years of limbo, unremovable but with no way to resolve their status, vulnerable to exploitation and either entirely destitute or being variously incarcerated and accommodated in quasi-detention One Lords amendment states that the governmentmust considerthe asylum claims of people deemed inadmissible if they havenot been removed after 6 months. There would then be no statutory duty to remove these people. This amendment isn’t perfect, at it doesn’t preserve a system of providing protection to those who need it (as the government would still initially refuse most asylum claims, and spend 6 months trying to remove those seeking sanctuary) – but it outs a statutory timeline and duty on how people seeking sanctuary should be treated. The Bill has no statutory limits or protections for the detention of pregnant women, meaning they would be detained without a time limit and our experience tells us for prolonged periods, with little or no access to healthcare. Another amendment preserves existing limits on the detention of pregnant women – protecting them from the long-term harms of detention. The Bill puts in no statutory limits or protections from the detention of children. TA collection of amendments retain existing limits on the detention of children. The Lords introduced amendments protecting both unaccompanied children and those travelling with families – many of whom will be young infants. Though much of the focus has been on unaccompanied children,it is vital that all children are protected from the lifelong trauma that detention inflicts. Much of the Bill contradicts and undermines international law,  the Refugee Convention. The Lords have passed an amendment stating that nothing in the Bill can be read to contradict key parts of international law specifically: These areall agreements the UK has committed to, and they are all designed primarily to protect human persons, especially in contexts where they are likely to be vulnerable. This amendment  also took out an opening clause that would mean everything in the Billhasto be read to effect removal from the UK. Keeping this amendment in the Bill is important to allow other positive amendments to work. The Bill blocks everyone from claiming asylum – including children. A further amendment stipulates that the government still consider asylum claims fromunaccompaniedchildren. The Bill strips aways protections for victims and survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking – in direct opposition to the Modern Slavery Act. A collection of amendments aim, in different ways, to preserve essential protections for victims and survivors of human trafficking and modern slavery. The Bill’s proposals for widespread forced removal do not take account of the  particular dangers faced by LGBT people. Another amendment stipulates countries to which LGBT people cannot be forcibly removed, reflecting the great and particular danger they would face. The Bill – incredibly unusually – contains a clause allowing the laws to apply retrospectively to people who have arrived from 7thMarch 2023. One Lords amendment states that the Bill, if passed, wouldn’t. We want to stick with the Refugee Convention; we don’t want to incarcerate children or pregnant women; we want to protect LGBT people and survivors of modern slavery; and we don’t want people trapped in limbo indefinitely when the government’s cruel and unworkable plan to remove them goes predictably wrong. Some minor changes to how amendments are referred to were made on 11th July. This was done to clear up any confusion, as amendents numbers can change during the parliamentary process.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"A further update on the “Refugee Ban Bill”, July 2023",04-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/a-further-update-on-the-refugee-ban-bill-july-2023/,"The Illegal Migration Bill, which would all but extinguish the right to claim asylum in the UK, is now at Report Stage in the House of Lords. It is troubling, indeed deeply saddening, to think that this horrifying Bill could become law before parliament goes into recess. However, there is still reason to hope. This is the key opportunity for Lords to amend the Bill before it is sent back to the House of Commons. In the first session of Report Stage last Wednesday, 28thJune, the Lords made important amendments to the Bill.Ifthey remained in the Bill, amendments made so far would lessen the destructive impact of the Bill in important ways: One key amendment states that, nothing in the Bill can be read to contradict key parts of international law, to which the UK is a signatory, designed to protect human beings, including, crucially, the Refugee Convention. The clause insisting on compliance with these international frameworks also took out the clause that would mean everything in the Billhasto be read to effect removal from the UK. Much of the Bill on the face of it does contradict international law, including the Refugee Convention, so if this stays in the Bill, it might give vulnerable people a chance to argue for their rights in court. Second, another amendment sought to ensure that the Bill, if passed, wouldn’t apply retrospectively to people who have arrived from 7thMarch 2023. It’s really unusual for laws to apply retrospectively, and makes accountability harder as it changes goalposts. A third amendment was aimed at protecting survivors of trafficking and modern slavery so that they would after all, havesomeaccess to the National Referral Mechanism designed to identify survivors. And a fourth amendment passed last Wednesday stipulates that the government would still consider asylum claims from unaccompanied children. As the Bill was originally drafted, even unaccompanied children would be routinely barred from claiming asylum under the Bill’s asylum ban clauses. Yesterday, -Monday-the government suffered further defeats. Crucially, peers voted for amendments that would retain existing limits on the detention of pregnant women and children. As drafted, the Bill would remove protections from these groups, allowing them to be held in immigration detention indefinitely. Report stage will continue tomorrow, 5thJuly 2023. When the Bill goes back to the House of Commons, MPs will have the chance to accept or reject these amendments, or to amend them again. They’ll also get a final chance to reject this cruel and unworkable Bill in its entirety. So it’s really important thateveryonewrites to their MPto tell them they don’t want a refugee ban bill, they want an asylum system that extends protection to those who need it. It’s really important that MPs realise this Bill was a mistake. Even if, remarkably, all the amendments seeking to retain protections for vulnerable groups and ameliorate the worst parts of the Bill were to pass, the Bill would still represent an unprecedented barrier to safety for refugees at best, destroy human lives, and be detrimental to the Common Good. But there is a chink of light in a dark time. We keep on striving for justice. Write to your MP and ask them to oppose the Illegal Migration Bill when it returns to the Commons!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,The availability of competent legal advice and representation for refugee friends is fast diminishing,27-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/the-availability-of-competent-legal-advice-and-representation-for-refugee-friends-is-fast-diminishing/,"The Home Office announcement that they were issuing 10,000 questionnaires to asylum seekers from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan was met with mixed reactions. On the one hand, the idea that swift action could be taken to resolve large numbers of cases where there had been delays was obviously welcome. On the other hand, the lack of consultation or thought meant that legal aid providers were faced with additional work on 10,000 cases with short deadlines as well as logistical difficulties such as contacting clients who had been moved round the country and dealing with those whose hopes and expectations were raised. Concerns about the way the questionnaires were being issued and the required responses were met bygaslighting and intimidation. But the truth always was that there simply isn’t the capacity amongst immigration legal aid providers – let alone good quality legal aid providers – to provide adequate legal representation on initial asylum applications. That’s before you add on the questionnaires, and then there are appeals, leave renewals, further submissions (fresh claims, applications where exceptional case funding has been obtained),- the list goes on, but capacity for legal advice is limited. This is not simply an issue for asylum seekers. It is far more fundamental. Legal Aid is the single most important plank of access to justice. Without access to free legal representation, access to justice is restricted to those who can pay for it. Where access to justice is not universal it ceases to be justice and the concept of the “rule of law” can no longer hold any weight. Legal Aid is not there because the government is kind. It exists to shore up the British legal system. 10 years on after the cuts introduced by LASPO the Legal Aid Sector is facing crises on all fronts.Jo Wilding, a barrister who has researched legal aid deserts in the UK, writes; “There was a 20% reduction in the number of housing legal aid providers in the 18 months to March 2023. The same period saw a 21% loss of legal aid providers for mental health, and a 27% loss in welfare benefits. In immigration and asylum, over 30% of the providers given contracts in September 2018 had stopped doing legal aid work by March 2023.” This is on top of the closures that followed the cuts in scope, in what legal aid would pay for, of 2012-14. Legal aid rates have not risen since 2007. This is effectively a 30% cut since the contract was introduced but sector wide and specific factors have combined to put an unprecedented strain on immigration legal aid practitioners. Home Office delays mean that providers have to keep cases open for much longer. Even if there is less substantial work to do on a case there are still enquiries from increasingly desperate refugees, and ongoing contact to be kept up. Adding extra unpaid work such as the questionnaires with short deadlines only compounds this and there’s little sign of swift case resolution. Taking immigration ( non-asylum ) work out of scope of legal aid meant that much expertise and many providers left the legal aid sector. The work can be done under legal aid if an additional barrier of an exceptional funding application is made but this does not create the extra caseworkers to do the applications that are so needed. The barriers set up by the home office – renewals of leave every 2.5 years for immigration cases, arbitrary refusals or rejections of cases which are clearly going to win at appeal or challenge, all create extra unnecessary work. This aspect of the hostile environment simply wastes resources to give the impression that the government is somehow in control. For workers in this sector, especially younger and newer lawyers, the pressures from the funding environment mean that it is harder to focus on providing the time and support that you know your clients need. And on top of this, successive Home and Justice secretaries deem it appropriate to directly abuse and threaten the sector. For some of us this is just confirmation we are doing something right but for others the rhetoric comes with a very real physical threat. Young Legal Aid Lawyers recently reportedthe pressures on younger/newer lawyers in immigration and record 1 in 5 saying they are leaving the sector or thinking about leaving. In the light of the above, who would blame them? Personally, I thought these numbers were surprisingly low and a credit to the dedication and resilience of so many, but the day-to-day experience of the legal project and destitution team at JRS is that the availability of competent legal advice and representation for our refugee friends is fast diminishing. There is a renewed focus in the sector to address this. Increasingly, frontline organisations are trying to address the advice gap themselves, trying to provide their own in-house legal teams as well as finding ways to make the best of decreasing capacity. It is what we have done at JRS, and it is something that is working for our refugee friends. But it can only be a short-term step. We need to be demonstrating models that could work for legal aid, for clients and caseworkers, not trying to replace it. It’s no more alright to give up on the provision of legal aid than it would be to accept food banks or night shelters instead of living wages or decent housing. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,How JRS’s Legal Project changed my life,22-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/how-jrss-legal-project-changed-my-life/,"B shares his experience of being supported by the JRS Legal Project to access justice and protection. Before I was supported by the Legal Project, I couldn’t work, I was not getting any support, and I couldn’t study. I was afraid – afraid I might be deported and separated from my family. I was afraid that if I went out, I wouldn’t come back home. I was able to have a meeting with Michael Tarnoky, Senior Legal Officer at JRS and he clarified the situation for me. Before that, I wasn’t 100% sure how to continue with my case to seek asylum in the UK. My case was stuck and he helped me move it on. I had an issue with a payment for my previous lawyer. It was an amount that I couldn’t afford. Michael explained how I could apply again but that I didn’t need to pay anything. This was all during Covid restrictions, and I think that processing my fresh claim would’ve been quicker without that, as we were only able to speak over the phone. Michael would come to my house to pick up my papers. That’s the kind of help you don’t imagine a lawyer to do, to come over to your house to collect your papers, making sure he keeps a distance because it is during the Covid pandemic. After support from the Legal Project, I started working. I have been working for some months now as the Home Office allowed me to work. Now I can study too, I am going out more and feel more relaxed. I can support my family. Everyday I have to remind myself that my life is different now to how it was before. My life has changed thanks to the JRS Legal Project. A supportive holistic approach The most important thing about the Legal Project is the approach – you take someone fromhere[the start of their case] and get them tothere[the end]. It is very personal and one-to-one. It is a much friendlier way to proceed, not judging you. It’s very personal, I could say anything and I would not be afraid to be judged. There’s nothing I would change about the Legal Project. If I want to talk to Michael, he responds straight away. Contacting Michael is very easy. Maybe on the phone not so much now, but with email he responds very quickly. The most important thing for me about JRS as a whole is the approach – you feel more relaxed, more accepted there. You don’t feel afraid to ask anything, you don’t feel like you’ll be rejected. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. I don’t go to any other charities because I like the approach here – keep doing what you are doing!  Support the JRS Legal Project with a Donation Today  [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"What is Sanctuary Sunday? In the face of expanding detention and hostility, it is much needed",20-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/what-is-sanctuary-sunday-in-the-face-of-expanding-detention-and-hostility-it-is-much-needed/,"An ecumenical endeavour brought about by Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, The Refugee Council and City of Sanctuary, Sanctuary Sunday is the Sunday at the end of Refugee Week, which falls 19-25 June this year. Sanctuary Sunday is an opportunity for churches and congregations to focus their Sunday worship on the issue of sanctuary, and to reflect on how we can all contribute to creating a culture of welcome and hospitality for asylum seekers and refugees in our communities. It is an opportunity to reflect, pray, and commit ourselves to celebrate and continue to build hospitality and sanctuary for all, especially those whose lives are most vulnerable, and most in danger. Offering sanctuary is a concept in stark contrast to Government proposals in the Illegal Migration Bill, currently being debated in Parliament, which will make it near impossible to claim asylum in the UK. The proposals involve a huge extension of the detention estate – envisaged alongside huge expansion of quasi-detention – of asylum seekers, which clearly militates against the concept of sanctuary. There areserious problems with immigration detention: it’s harmful, expensive and often ineffective. Incarceration in detention centres does not help people progress their asylum claims – most people are ultimately released back into the community with little progress on their cases being made. This, coupled with the effects on mental and physical health and its cost, show clearly that detention is not a way to work towards resolving asylum seekers’ cases with dignity. The government must abandon plans to bar access to the asylum system – and it must process asylum claims in the community. Immigration detention serves no good purpose. Asylum claims can and should be better processed in the community. Indeed, there can be community-based alternatives to detention which potentially take deprivation of liberty out of the immigration system. One example, developed by the International Detention Coalition is the Community Assessment and Placement model, a framework that brings together many of the alternatives to detention mechanisms which their research identified. It is described as “a tool for governments, civil society and other stakeholders to build systems that ensure detention is only used as a last resort and that community options result in optimal outcomes”. The benefits are for individuals, governments and societies, such as trust and engagement as case managers build consistent trust relationships with individuals, encouraging engagement with immigration processes. It leads to improved coping and well-being as they facilitate access to services and support mechanisms. Personal stability is increased, enabling people to make difficult, life changing decisions. Case managers ensure people have access to all relevant information, and act as a link between the individual and the authorities, supporting timely and informed decision-making. All leading to timely and fair case resolution, as all migration options are explored, and individuals are better equipped to work towards resolving their cases. Clearly, crude incarceration of vulnerable human beings is not only cruel – it is also not the cleverest way forward. There are other options, which might not be political vote-winners but which could provide better outcomes for all. The Bill, and lots of Government and media rhetoric, seem to suggest that offering hospitality is much harder than creating hostility. In fact,analysisfrom the Refugee Council estimates that in the first three years the Bill is in force, between £8.7bn and £9.6bn will have been spent on detaining and accommodating people denied access to asylum. Furthermore, the alternative pilots, where detention is used only as a last resort, show that community-based resolution has the best outcomes. Churches and faith groups across the country are increasingly part of the movement to offer creative and heart-felt welcome and hospitality to refugees. Some of these churches may be formally signed up to the Church of Sanctuary initiative. Others may be involved in outreach and service, fundraising or prayer activities with and for refugees and asylum seekers. A theology of sanctuary is not new to our faith – churches have had a long history of offering refuge – and we may not always remember how important this is. The command to “love the stranger as yourself” is repeated at least 36 times in the Bible – the children of Israel clearly needed reminding of this, just as we do now. Offering a welcome need not be daunting – theChurch of Sanctuary websitehas a number of resources to support individuals, churches, and community groups, offering reflections, prayers, and ideas for action.Scottish Faith Action for Refugeeshas also produced a beautiful resource to aid worship, ‘the God who sees me’, as well as a video series, “Journeys of Faith and Welcome”, which tells the stories of people seeking safety and faith communities.Together with Refugeeshave produced a “Hospitality Not Hostility” toolkit for faith groups to assist community groups who want to host a meal or tea for refugees. We encourage you to take a look at these resources, and that this Sanctuary Sunday is the start of a journey of offering hospitality in your community. Read more: [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Creating messages of justice,15-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/creating-messages-of-justice/,"JRS UKwalked10km as part of the London Legal Walk on the13thJune 2023. The walk traversedLondon’s main parks andwas done in support of much needed frontline legal advice agencies. Without access togood qualitylegal advice, refugees and asylum seekers face destitution and their immigration statusremainsunresolved. JRSUKwalkedin support of its own in-houseLegal Project so it can continue toprovidespecialist advice and representation to those in need.Prior tothe walk, JRS hosted a flag-making workshop for refugee friends.  Why did you host a flag-making class? Every Monday we host a Create & Make class which allows refugee friends to escape from whatever uncertainties they face in their daily lives. I think it’s important for our friends to feel part of something bigger than themselves where they can contribute. The London Legal Walk provided ample opportunity to do so. The flag-making class allowed refugee friends the opportunity to give back to the wider community. Knowing that the work they produced in the class would have an impact beyond JRS wasincrediblymeaningful. The lack ofgood qualitylegal aid is what unites our refugee friendsand all others the London LegalWalk is in support of. Despite every individual having their own unique need for legal aid, whether they face deprivation, unemployment or have an unresolved immigration status, it is the shared experience of struggling to receive reasonable legal aid that unites the wider community. What were refugee friends’ experience like when making the flags? The class began with a brief introduction explaining what the London Legal Walk was and the purpose behind the event. Once refugee friends understood how we were advocating for justice they got a lot more involved. It was apparent how each friend was giving careful consideration to the message they wanted their flag to sport. They all enjoyed creating their own specific calls for justice or creating a message of thanks to those who have helped them. I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere of the session. In the beginning, it was a little quiet but by the end there was a humdrum of activity as refugee friends shared their messages of help with each other and inspired me with their visions for justice. How do refugee friends feel about the London Legal Walk? They were proud to demand justice and expect fairer treatment for those who are suffering and will suffer in the future like they did. Refugee friends particularly enjoyed the class as it provided a safe space for them to express their opinions without raising concerns over the potentially detrimental effect to their own immigration status. What do you hope the London Legal Walk will achieve? Well I have never been on one before so it’s my first one! I hope that frontline legal aid services receive more funding and can provide to those in need. The number of which is continually growing as cost-of-living budget cuts swing into place and the hostility context continues to threaten more livelihoods daily. I hope that refugee friends enjoy the day out in the sunshine and the company and relish in their power to advocate and fight back.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"Performing poetry this Refugee Week – putting joyful, funny, complex refugee voices at the centre of the narrative",13-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/performing-poetry-this-refugee-week-putting-joyful-funny-complex-refugee-voices-at-the-centre-of-the-narrative/,"Refugee Week 2023 will run from Monday 19th to Sunday 25th June. Ahead of Refugee Week, we sat down with Mark, Community Projects Coordinator, to learn more about what JRS will be doing to celebrate. What is Refugee Week? Refugee Week is an important week in the UK – and now in lots of other countries – which celebrates the contributions and value of refugees in our communities. With a myriad of arts and cultural events, it’s a week in which we highlight how much our communities benefit from and are strengthened by the presence of refugees, with all the gifts and new perspectives they bring to our society. In this hostile environment, it’s more important than ever to stand together and show solidarity with those who come to the UK seeking safety and sanctuary. Media and government narratives try to separate and divide, and scapegoat refugees as victims that just ‘take’ – as people who are needy and damaging to us as individuals and as a society. Refugee Week shows us the opposite of that is true. The celebrations of Refugee Week are a powerful demonstration of refugees being our equals in society, with inherent dignity and unique and special talents. We see this demonstrated in the joy and love they bring to friends, family and new communities in the UK. Refugee Week is a joyful celebration which counters the hostilities and trauma many refugees face – on their journeys and continued here in the UK. Refugee Week shows that we are stronger together. What are JRS doing for Refugee Week? On Thursday of Refugee Week we’ll be holding an internal celebration day just for refugee friends, volunteers, and staff to come together. This is something refugee friends have asked for – a space and a day for the community to join together and have fun together. This day will be the launch of a regular social space we want to host, bringing peer support and socialising back into the centre on a regular basis.We haven’t done a large scale event like this since before the pandemic. JRS will also be present at events celebrating the launch ofYou can see me, but I don’t exist, a photography and poetry exhibit which speaks to the extended periods of uncertainty that many refugees face whilst waiting to hear on their asylum claims. The long-exposure photography – which blurs refugee friends’ faces – speaks to the dehumanization and marginalisation of asylum seekers in our society, whilst the poetry speaks to these experiences of not being seen – but also of the complexities, the ups and downs of the rest of life. See what’s on and join JRS for Refugee Week 2023 Refugee friends are practicing in the centre this week for their performances next week with the help of poet Laila Sumpton. It sounds really joyful – through the door I’ve heard lots of singing and chanting, sounds you might hear in a local market. Their performances at the various external events during Refugee Week won’t be poetry done traditionally, but instead it’ll be dynamic and sensational. To see that work come to life will be really great. All of the poems they’ll be performing next week were written by the whole group – all of the poems are collaborative. There’s one that is particularly funny which has everyone involved in performing. It’s nice to show that refugees aren’t just in tragic circumstances – the collection of poetry shows very well the full breadth of their experiences; their joyful, funny and complex lives. They are all complex human beings, like each and every one of us. What special importance does Refugee Week have? It’s hugely important that people and society have an opportunity to hear refugee voices, particularly from refugees themselves. Refugee Week is the perfect opportunity to encourage society to hear the voices of refugees. Even with good narratives, it’s essential that refugees are in control of their own stories. Having seen all the hard work, and knowing how skilled, creative, and joyful JRS refugee friends are, it’s a great honour – and very important – for JRS to share that work externally. JRS plays a vital role in making sure that individuals affected by the hostile environment are connected to global movements, and have access to be a part of things like Refugee Week. We’re always learning how better to make refugees voices the heart and centre of what we do. I hope you’ll join us for Refugee Week, and participate in the wider Refugee Week events more generally. It’s also not too late to host an event yourself – the Refugee Week website has lots of ideas for things you could do. Whatever you do, I hope Refugee Week is an exciting opportunity to learn more and experience genuine encounter. I look forward to updating you all on what we get up to at JRS!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Who’s that walking at my door?,30-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/whos-that-walking-at-my-door/,"When I first started my role at JRS two months ago, I attended one of the immigration training sessions JRS UK offers for volunteers. The session outlined immigration law in the UK, the intricacies involved in applying for asylum, and the role frontline services play in helping individuals who are seeking sanctuary in the UK. The complexity and the cruelty of the UK asylum system, when coupled with a lack of good quality legal advice, can leave individuals seeking asylum caught in a perpetual legal limbo. It is disheartening to know asylum seekers are often teetering between destitution and detention simply because they cannot access good quality specialist immigration advice and legal representation. Learning all this has highlighted to me the value and importance of our in-house Legal Project. I appreciate the services JRS UK provides to a vastly under-resourced sector. The specialist legal advice and representation provided by the Legal Project is highly commendable, and I am always personally very touched by the care and consideration the Legal Project’s team shows to each refugee friend who registers with us. The Legal Project helps rebuild lives and brings together communities.  As part of my work at JRS UK, I am organising our participation in this year’s London Legal Walk to raise funds for the Legal Project. For 19 years, the London Legal Walk has brought together the legal community to support and fundraise to provide free frontline legal advice services. The asylum system has been hit hard by cuts to legal aid in the last few years, and, as the cost-of-living rises, the need is greater than ever. This is why I’d like to invite you, our JRS supporters, to either walk with us on the day, meet us at the finish line, or to donate to our enthuse page and help us reach our goal of £2500. Want to take part on Tuesday 13thJune? The Legal Project Without secure immigration status, the refugees we support are destitute: they are unable to work, access government financial support, rent or open a bank account. JRS UK has been providing free, high quality legal advice and representation to refugee friends since 2019 and, in this time, has ensured 21 refugee friends have been granted leave to remain status in the UK. Many of the refugee friends we work with have no other representation. We know that being granted secure immigration status can be a long and difficult journey for our refugee friends. That is why the legal project also focuses on empowering refugee friends on that journey by improving their understanding of their legal rights. We run expert legal rights workshops for refugee friends on immigration enforcement powers, the asylum process and how legal aid and legal representation should work in practice.  Want to take part? We would like to invite you to donate and/or walk alongside us in the London Legal Walk in June. Our route will take us past scenic sites such as Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and St James Park. If you’re unable to join us, please do encourage us from the side-lines, especially if we’re walking past your door! You are also very welcome to join us at the finish line on Carey Street, where we’ll be celebrating at a street party complete with fire jugglers, food vendors and musicians. Your support will go towards ensuring refugee friends have access to the legal representation they need to be recognized as a refugee here in the UK and find a route out of the destitution they face. Thank you for your continued generosity and support.  Meet our team: Jemima Tanner, Megan Knowles, Eileen Cole, Michael Tarnoky, Mark Dunn, Sophie Cartwright, Victoria Firth, Danning He, William Neal, Jasmine Husseini, Lilian Djoukouo, Amy-Leigh Hatton, Gordon Parker, Kevin Alexander and Liz Clarke. Read others’ past experiences The London Legal walk brings together legal firms, barristers chambers and organizations like JRS to walk 10km across London to raise much needed funds for not-for-profit and legal aid providers. 10km didn’t sound like too much at first, but by about a 1/3 of the way through, I was feeling the aches in my legs begin! –Reham, FormerJRS Digital Communications Officer The legal team at JRS provides essential legal advice and representation for refuge friends who are trapped in legal limbo and forever waiting to be recognized as refugees in need of international protection. The demands on their services are ever greater so this fundraising walk is crucial in supporting our legal team. –Benjamin Cornwell, Former JRS Grants Officer The route through London’s beautiful royal parks is very appealing and fortunately the weather was warm and sunny on the day, allowing the volunteers to walk enthusiastically and have some valuable time talking along the way. We saw several fellow organizations joining the walk, happy to see people of the same cause walking for justice –William Neal JRS Detention and Legal Caseworker  [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"Getting to know and love JRS, through volunteering",30-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/getting-to-know-and-love-jrs-through-volunteering/,"During the Covid pandemic, I was living in Folkestone. It was a strange time for everyone. I’d never heard about Napier Barracks until there was a local community meeting where we heard that asylum seekers were already being held in the disused barracks on the top of the hill, without any consultation amongst the local community. The local people were very good, and they were concerned that this was not a good place for refugees, it was isolated and very dilapidated. They wanted to support them and show them some welcome. I volunteered quite early with a group visiting Napier, and whilst I was there, there was the serious Covid outbreak, and I needed to isolate in case of infection. An important part of volunteering in a situation like that involves an awareness that you have no idea whom you will meet and what needs they have. Some people are highly skilled and organised, articulate and clear about what they want and plan to do. Others might be very vulnerable, whilst also highly intelligent, and I might not be able to understand or even help them. So my approach has always been to just be myself. To not expect anything, to not expect to be welcomed, not expect everyone to be happy with my help. To be there, to listen, and be ready to do my best. A ‘typical’ day A typical day would look rather chaotic, we’d arrive at the camp and just wait around. There was nowhere to go, nowhere to sit and meet people. Word got round and other NGOs like Samphire and Kent Refugee Help began attending, as well as individuals, members of the public, both local and from further afield. They were concerned, caring people who wanted to help. I joined a new group calledFriends of Napierand I visited regularly along with some religious Sisters who used to visit those in detention and that’s where I first met JRS staff and volunteers. It was difficult to find any privacy to have a conversation in Napier, so that’s why it was so important that theNapier Drop-In Centre began in the Church Halldown the hill from the barracks. Many people needed our support, many were unable to function without help.  I began to go once a week, either to the barracks or the Drop-In. Information was translated into various languages, I was able to help with that. It was a real and wonderful experience and opportunity to recognise the human spirit, and what can be achieved even in such a constrained situation. I met a Syrian man one day. He and his two brothers became separated when they were trying to get to the UK. Two arrived here and one was in Napier. Out of the blue, he received a message from his younger brother saying that he was drowning in the sea, and please help. He had no idea where he was. The day was spent speaking to international rescue, going from one contact to another (a journey of discovery). With the help of Italians, Germans and other groups, the drowning brother at sea was found and he survived. It is an incredible story of communicating by mobile phone from Napier and helping a younger brother in need. My small part was to support this brother through this traumatic time. There is another long story I was involved with – about an Eritrean who was kidnapped in Libya– we managed to help his brother at Napier with support, with advice and information. Not really ‘typical’ days for most people. Through my work there I managed to get a job as an outreach visitor to Napier as a supporter of refugees. I was able to be a translator for many people, it was so important to be able to give them time. Community Volunteering It was so heart-warming to see the generosity and kindness of the local community in and around Folkestone. People brought their talents to share with the refugees, like teaching music, providing materials to make beautiful Arts and Crafts. There were legal support groups from local solicitors. Some brought sewing machines and fabrics to make clothes, or design their own T-Shirts. The combination of locally organised groups, established charities and individuals provided some important relief to some very anxious and traumatised people. Friends for life I am still in contact with people from the local community in Folkestone, who have been very supportive of refugees. They have tried to do the right things. They were not happy with the lack of consultation from the Government, and it wasn’t a good idea to side-line them. We are facing an international crisis and they have stepped up in their own way. Occasionally I meet someone whom I met years back, perhaps on a train, or in the street, and they recognise and speak to me in a friendly, grateful way. There is a deep connection due to volunteering. I am so grateful to the good Sisters who visit Napier, from whom I learnt so much, and all who give their time and talents to those held in quasi-detention. And of course, to JRS. I consider myself very fortunate to be able to work in such an organisation as this. Want to learn more? The Jesuit Refugee Service UK (JRS UK)’s report ‘Napier Barracks: the inhumane reality’shines a light onto the experiences of people placed in the asylum camp at the disused Napier Barracks in Kent. JRS UK ran an outreach service to Napier for two years from October 2020. What we saw on the ground was deeply troubling: the site was bleak and rundown, the setting was securitised, the accommodation was crowded. This all took a serious toll on mental health. The report draws from the accounts of 17 forcibly displaced people supported by JRS UK held in Napier Barracks between July and November 2022. Read the report [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Coronation Community Kitchen: Cooking together for King and Country!,16-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/coronation-community-kitchen-cooking-together-for-king-and-country/,"Tomarkthe coronation JRShelda specialone-offcommunity coronation kitchen programmetowhich refugee friends,volunteers,and staffmemberswere invitedtocook up a feast for the street partyonWapping Green.  The highlight of my day was tackling the Baklava. I’m glad to report that working with the other participants to carefully follow our refugee friends’ guidance, led to unmitigated Baklava success!  The day was terrific, and everyone enjoyed learning about a range of cuisines and cultures in preparation for the coronation. In the words of one participant: “The Coronation Community Kitchen makes me feel connected with different people with different cultures and with different foods.”  JRS’ special Coronation Community Kitchen programme brought together local volunteers,  refugee friends and members of the JRS team. Initially, we were tasked with creating 500 personal pizzas. Learning how to make the dough and sauce from scratch (whilst being directed by a real Italian volunteer!) was unforgettable. Participants then split into smaller groups tobake in batches whilst refugee friends produced Nigerian puff puff balls in abundance. Once all the cooking was completed, the JRS centre transformed into a café-esque social space to which everyone – not just the cooks – were  invited to come and spend time together enjoying the fruits of our labours.   Community Kitchen – Where it all started The beauty of the regular JRS Community Kitchen is refugee friends teaching one another how to cook a meal. Not all refugee friends have access to a kitchen, so the Community Kitchen gives them both the joy and opportunity of cooking and the ownership of the space together with other refugee friends. As one refugee friend shared, “Community Kitchen makes me feel amazing! I love how the group is so varied and from different walks of life. Cooking recipes from people’s cultures is a brilliant way to understand their cultures better, also chatting with others about where they are from’. Another explained: “It has been lovely to connect with others in a fun setting and lots of laughter and everyone ‘working’ alongside each other.” Joy as resistance is important, it provides a powerful contrast to the hostility of a degrading asylum system.  Community Kitchen provides not only practical knowledge for all who attend but further celebrates the variety of cultures and personalities present in the mixing pot! Nevertheless, in the words of another happy participant: “Community Kitchen gave me a common space to find that the ‘different’ someone was not that different at all.”  The special one-off Coronation Community Kitchen was funded by Tower Hamlets, as part of the Coronation celebrations. We are hoping to continue Community Kitchen – and similar activities – which bring refugee friends and the local community together. Can you help us? Donate today [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,A brief update on the Illegal Migration Bill,16-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/a-brief-update-on-the-illegal-migration-bill/,"The Illegal Migration Bill has now passed Second Reading in the House of Lords. Committee Stage in the House of Lords – which will involve the whole house – is scheduled to take place on 24thMay. To recap, the Bill would ban most refugees from claiming asylum, hugely expand the use of detention, including reintroducing the routine and indefinite detention of children, and strip modern slavery survivors of protection. It places a duty on the Home Secretary to remove those deemed inadmissible to the asylum system – i.e., under the Bill, nearly everyone claiming asylum. However, in most cases, removal is likely to prove impossible. Therefore, the outcome will be hundreds of thousands of people living in limbo either detained, destitute, or in inhumane but costly asylum accommodation, indefinitely. This would be a humanitarian catastrophe. At second reading in the House of Lords, the Bill in its current form faced huge opposition, including from the Archbishop of Canterbury who, in an unprecedented move, personally led critique of the Bill, calling it “morally unacceptable” and “impractical”. It is likely that the Lords will suggest significant changes to the Bill at Committee stage. JRS UK continues to call for the Illegal Migration Bill to be scrapped. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Running the London Marathon: it exceeded all my expectations!,15-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/running-the-london-marathon-it-exceeded-all-my-expectations/,"How was your experience running the London Marathon? I had a wonderful experience running the London Marathon, it exceeded all my expectations! Did you enjoy being part of Team JRS? It was great to be part of JRS, I especially appreciated everybody’s willingness to connect via social networks and train together before the event.  We had a lovely coordinator Danning, who was continuously encouraging us, being optimistic and supportive throughout fundraising and particularly on the day of the event when JRS members cheered for us on our journey. What would you tell someone who is considering to take on this challenge? I would say don’t be afraid of the distance! The atmosphere of the Marathon is unique; there are bands playing, people cheering, co-runners encouraging others, energy gels, waters and jellybeans handed out in plenty. The journey in itself is stunning, you get to run past and through some of the most iconic London sights. It was definitely worth the pain! How did you prepare to run your first marathon? Originally, I was supposed to run my first London Marathon 3 years ago. I was training really hard, multiple times a week, long runs. Then the COVID happened and with it a few lockdowns, so the Marathon kept on getting postponed. I even broke my arm last September and had to postpone the Marathon again, not being able to train. Finally, I started to train in January but due to workload I could not do more than one-hour run a week which is not much (and sometimes I even skipped those due to travelling and moving!). I believe that because of my background in dance, years of training and running beforehand and general love of sport, the muscles “remembered” the hard work and therefore it worked out well in the end.  SUPPORT TEAM JRS’S FUNDRAISERS  What was your fundraising journey like? And any tips for future JRS runners? The fundraising was not easy, I was quite surprised that many people I personally know didn’t contribute or show interest, but people I barely knew, did.  Frankly, not many of my close friends donated also which was quite sad. I was also surprised that not many Catholics I reached out to (e.g. a young adult girl Catholic group I attend) contributed or I did not feel being very supported. Many times, I got discouraged and did not want to ask people again or to promote the event again when I didn’t get any response or support. I think that the best way is to send individual messages and ask people individually (which I did not do because it seemed to be a bit pushy), but I think that would probably work! My tip would be to start fundraising early and attaching photos to your social media showing that you are getting ready for the Marathon, not losing enthusiasm and especially in the last 2 weeks before the event to promote it constantly! Well done and a huge thank you to Anna for being a part of our team of marathon runners this year!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Social Justice in Action – Can you become a volunteer host?,15-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/social-justice-in-action-can-you-become-a-volunteer-host/,"For our friends seeking asylum, one of the most powerful forms of social justice in action takes place at home, through refugee hosting schemes pairing volunteer hosts with refugees in desperate need of accommodation. Through the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS UK)’s hosting scheme, ‘At Home’, refugees are welcomed in individual households, parishes, or religious communities who are able and willing to offer accommodation for a mutually agreed period, appropriate to host and guest. By opening their homes to a stranger, our volunteer hosts respond to the call for hospitality. In his latest encyclical,Fratelli Tutti, Pope Francis renews his invitation to us all to take concrete steps to welcome, protect, promote, and integrate refugees and migrants seeking sanctuary on our shores: “The arrival of those who are different, coming from other ways of life and cultures, can be a gift”(Fratelli Tutti, 133).This gift is of a ‘culture of encounter’, through which host communities and new arrivals can exchange the gifts of one another’s culture and enrich all those involved. One of our hosts, Nora, discussed her inspiration for getting involved with hosting: “I had quite a big house for just myself, with spare rooms—for just me, you know? So, I couldn’t say no. The Lord was looking down on me, saying ‘what about those spare rooms?’ I am pleased I did it.” “I thought that it could have been me, you know? I could have been in that position. It is rewarding even though it’s just day-to-day living. But, nevertheless, at the end of the day, for her, [my guest], it is something big.” Volunteers are the driving force of our ‘At Home’ hosting scheme. They appreciate that behind the label ‘refugee’ or ‘asylum seeker’ is a person of dignity – a person with a story, hopes, dreams and fears, who like all of us, is seeking to get on with their life. This mutual, sustained encounter between refugee and host puts principles of social justice into practice. It is an act of charity which upholds dignity, shows solidarity with the vulnerable, and increases avenues of participation for those who need it most. One refugee guest, who has been hosted twice through JRS UK’s hosting scheme, told us: “From hosting, I learnt something very important in my life, psychologically, is that love can be given by anyone. Before that, I was always thinking that it was only my parents, and family, and best friends who can give me that love, but later on, I realised that it can be given by anyone.” At present our hosting scheme is inurgent need of more hosts. In an increasingly hostile environment, where resources are dwindling for charities and legal-aid providers, our refugee friends are left waiting in limbo for even longer – reliant on charities for accommodation. We are also anticipating need increasing as backlogs of asylum-claims are poorly dealt with, leaving more people destitute. The security of a home to return to amid debilitating uncertainty allows JRS’s refugee friends to live with dignity – not constantly in a state of worry about where to sleep or find food and soap. These seemingly basic concerns can be all-consuming and prevent our refugee friends from thinking strategically about important decisions ahead. Please consider whether you would be willing to give a refugee friend a chance to live in dignity and to learn from each other in a hosting placement.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Folkestone folk support the Napier report and the closure of Napier Barracks,02-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/folkestone-folk-support-the-napier-report-and-the-closure-of-napier-barracks/,"JRS UK launched our latest report,Napier Barracks: the inhumane realityto a packed audience in Folkestone last week.Eileen Coleshares the highlights from the evening. Former resident of Napier Barracks, Waleed, aged 20, who fled his country due to religious persecution, kept the packed audience wrapt in admiration and solidarity as he told his story of being a refugee and his time spent in Napier. He highlightedthe issue with isolation – “…it extends to most asylum accommodation. It is not only systemic but societal. We feel unwanted, so we don’t feel like we can socialise.” The need for integration into the local community and our society is a constant concern of our work at JRS and anyone who cares about the future of asylum seekers and refugees.At the local launch of the Napier Reportin Folkestone on a wet, windy April evening, local residents packed the venue to hear about the findings and to meet former residents and hear their testimonies of being held in Napier barracks. They expressed their deep concerns about the treatment of refugees and their willingness to help in any way they could. This attitude of goodwill was heart-warming, especially considering the fatigue that can be placed on a local community when new cohorts of refugees are brought in every 90 days, as happens at Napier. The men usually have very few possessions and need coats and shoes in the colder months of the year. The local community have shown consistent generosity in providing these things and more, but there is a limit to the capacity to do so. One local resident, Sally Hough, who formed part of the panel presenting the report, established andruns theNapier Barracks Drop-Incentre which isa safe and friendly place away from the barracks, where people can come in and receive advice, help accessing legal advice, receive practical support and participate in activities such as arts, sports and English language classes. Sally expressed another aspect of the regular turnover of residents at Napier: “We build up friendship and confidence with the Napier residents, and within a few months they are moved on and we have to start again with the new intake. Every single resident is a person with a name, a face, a future; this is a cruel way for them to be treated, especially when they have overcome such odds to get here.” Author of the report,Sophie Cartwright responded to questions from local residents asking “what can we do to help?”, she said: “in this alarmingly hostile context local resistance and solidarity has worked to stop asylum camps opening. I hope that can be a part of getting Napier closed.” She noted that the local MP was unable to attend the evening and continued: “It will make a difference to write your MP. In other constituencies things have changed when MPs have understood the strength of feeling locally. It’s worth also engaging with local authorities and councillors. Making it clear refugees are welcome here, and should not be ‘imprisoned’ in camps.” There is so much more to convey from the wonderful evening, and we will do so in the coming weeks. In the meantime, it behoves us to highlight the superb meal prepared with such alacrity and skill by three refugee friends from Syria, Sudan and Afghanistan. Everyone was treated to a healthy, abundant, – gourmet! – meal, with no fuss, an amazingly smooth operation which gave the possibility for lively discussion and encounter to happen over dinner before the final Q&A and reluctant dispersal of an engaged local community, brought together to discuss such an urgent issue of our time. JRS UK works alongside Sally and the team at the Napier Drop-In to offer hospitality, accompaniment and practical support to men held at Napier. If you can support their work in any way, please do donate atthe Napier Drop-In’s JustGiving page. [Back to the blog]"

I’m in charge of the practical support we offer from our centre, which includes the JRS Shop where friends can pick up essential food & toiletries, access to phone credit, and bi-weekly top-ups of £15 to refugee friends. Every two weeks, refugee friends supported by JRS are given a £15 hardship grant on their “Equals card”. This is a card that works like a bank or a debit card. Many asylum seekers are prohibited from accessing financial services such as bank accounts, so an Equals card is a way we can provide secure access to money without determining or limiting how it should be spent, which would be the case if we provided vouchers and coupons, for example. As one refugee friend put it:“Sometimes charities give vouchers for specific shops – which I do appreciate – but sometimes I need to travel to reach a branch of that shop, which costs money in itself. Sometimes the shop is expensive and I know I’d be able to get things cheaper elsewhere.” This system means that refugee friends can directly buy the things they need, from spaces that are accessible, making better, more resourceful choices suitable to them. This means that limited funds – we know these payments aren’t enough – can go even further. One refugee friend told me:“Having the cash available on a card means that I can make my own choices – I can shop around. I can budget better.” The Equals card has features similar to a debit card. In addition to providing some security and convenience (think back to peak Covid times, when many shops weren’t taking cash payments – many still don’t), there is an app which friends can use to view transactions and budget accordingly. The Equals cards can thus provide a sense of control and agency for refugee friends, even it is small. We’ve found too that Equals provides an easy transition for asylum seekers when they are granted refugee status and can open bank accounts, as they have already had experiences of using and managing bank cards. We don’t place any conditions on the money we distribute, nor do we ask refugee friends to report to us how they use it. We do have some idea on main areas of spend from what refugee friends have shared with us when we collected feedback on our switch to using Equals cards. One refugee friend told me:“Receiving the £15 bi-weekly payment has been extremely valuable. With the bi-weekly payments, I am able to use the money to do the laundry and travel to places and appointments without the need of asking others for funds. For some, receiving the bi-weekly payments might not be sufficient, but for me, it is useful as I have no other financial recourse and it gives me a sense of financial empowerment.” Though we provide other assistance at our centre, the money is still essential to meeting basic needs. For example, our JRS Shop has basic pantry items, but we might not always have certain cultural or dietary foods which refugee friends require. The Equals cards are also used to pay for travel, to the JRS centre and to other appointments. These bi-weekly hardship grants thus allow those we support to develop human and social capital, enabling access to travel to see friends, or to attend college or religious or cultural events/communities. I’ve often heard that it is “a good rule of thumb” to have at least three months’ outgoings accessible as savings. These £15 payments definitely don’t provide that, but they do hopefully give a bit of cushion to afford last minute emergency situations, such as urgent and unexpected medical or legal appointments. For some refugee friends, £15 hardship grants fortnightly may be adequate alongside other support from JRS and other organisations. However, some of those we serve receive financial support only from JRS, which means they are very stretched. With the recent increases in the cost of living, our support is stretched even thinner for refugee friends. Though the money isn’t enough, what we are able to contribute is valued by refugee friends. In the words of one refugee friend: “Lots of people need money… what can I do? We can do nothing. They give you something, you have to appreciate it.” We will continue to support refugee friends in all the ways we can, including these fortnightly payments. In its small, inadequate way, we hope it hands back to those we accompany some choice and financial freedom, as well as making accessible essential goods and travel. We can’t do this without your help, and I would like to say thank you for all your generosity in helping us to walk with refugees. Donate today [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Earth Day and JRS – a reflection,25-Apr-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/earth-day-and-jrs-a-reflection/,"It was a powerful, uplifting experience to join with some 100,000 people in London on Earth Day, which is an annual invitation to protect and celebrate the incredible biodiversity of our planet. The day has increasingly become about finding collective, creative solutions to the ecological crisis, particularly when those in power seem so absent from those solutions. The obvious link between Earth Day and our work at JRS is that climate disaster is going to cause unprecedented displacement globally. Our international mission of accompaniment, service and advocacy for refugee friends will play a vital role for years to come. But charitable responses will not be enough. We need to respond to displacement with compassionate policies, a just division of responsibility, and practical solutions. Not media-driven hysteria and a ‘crisis’ orchestrated by inadequate, cruel policies. We also need to fight. Defending our natural world is intrinsically linked to upholding the rights and humanity of our international brothers and sisters. Because the climate crisis is based on existing systems of oppression and inequality. By tackling these at the root, we can start to imagine a vision of a future which we ALL need. So, after a weekend full of bright and beautiful celebrations in London, I urge you to continue taking action. Please stand in solidarity with refugees and migrants. Uphold their humanity and offer them welcome in your communities. Show kindness, seek volunteering opportunities or offer financial support so that people can live in dignity. I truly believe that hosting refugees is one of the most POWERFUL forms of resistance to the hostile environment. Hosting provides welcome and sanctuary to people who have had so much stripped of them because of our systems of oppression. If you’d like to find out more, head to our hosting page here:https://www.jrsuk.net/at-home-hosting-scheme/ Or join us at our upcoming information event at Farm Street Church on May 30th, 7pm.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Cheering for Team JRS at the London Marathon 2023,18-Apr-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/cheering-london-marathon-2023/,"Four dedicated runners—Ana, Eileen, Anna, and Francis—will be running the London Marathon this Sunday to fundraise for JRS UK. The money they are raising will directly support our services in welcoming destitute refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. A team of refugee friends, volunteers, and staff members will be energetically cheering them on along the 26.2-mile route. And everyone reading this is welcome to join at one or both of our cheering points atBermondsey (mile 11.5-12)andMudchute (mile 16-16.5)– an opportunity to meet some of the JRS team – or you may wish to encourage the runners from another vantage point – there is plenty of space along the route! To prepare to be one of the best cheering crowds at the marathon this year, we all gathered at our Wapping centre earlier this month to make creative posters and signs that we will be holding. We were of course joined by some of our refugee friends who will directly benefit from the funded services that the runners’ campaigns will support. Join Our Cheering JRS UK relies on donations from individuals to support our work with destitute asylum seekers through our Centre in Wapping and hardship fund, assisting refugee friends with their basic needs. We provide regular hardship grants to enable people to travel across London to access essential services, to attend immigration, medical and legal appointments, and to buy everyday essential items they may need. Alongside food and clothing, we provide essential toiletries including soap, shampoo, shower-gel, toothpaste, toothbrushes, toilet paper, and sanitary towels. Hardship grants, food and toiletries are given to destitute refugees, who do not receive benefits, have no right to work, and no access to government asylum support. We also offer small grants for educational needs and sometimes assist with exceptional needs. Help JRS Runners Meet Their Fundraising Targets [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"Napier barracks shows we need communities, not camps",04-Apr-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/napier-barracks-shows-we-need-communities-not-camps/,"Over several months in 2022, I had in-depth conversations with people placed at the asylum camp at Napier barracks – a bleak and dilapidated barracks that has been repurposed to accommodate asylum seekers. The findings are published in JRS UK’s newreportNapier barracks: the inhumane reality.What I heard was truly disturbing. Napier was a site of re-trauma, where refugees are forced to relive memories of being brutalised in refugee camps on another continent as children, where the walls, security, and restrictions on daily activities make it feel like prison. Most research participants compared Napier to a prison.  People talked about how they would have freedom when they got out and could structure their own lives:“When I leave this place I can decide when to eat, when to exercise, when to do work.”A loud, busy environment devoid of privacy makes respite impossible and enforces near universal sleep deprivation on residents. One young man described being in Napier as “asphyxiating”. They are cut off from the wider community and made to feel less human. These profoundly negative impacts arise directly from Napier’s institutional, prison-like, camp set-up. Our research of course follows a lot of controversy about conditions at the site, including a June 2021 High Court ruling that it was inadequate to meet the minimum standards for asylum accommodation. The Home Office claims since then to have made many improvements at the site. What is striking, though, is how much continuity there is between the experiences JRS UK’s team heard about from men placed there shortly after Napier opened, and the experiences relayed in this report. Re-trauma, chronic sleep deprivation, and a deterioration in mental health were characteristic of life at the site before, and they are now. A key reason for this is that adjustments within that setting don’t stop it from being harmful. For example, though there used to be a culture of intimidating Napier residents, many research participants now report good relationships with staff, saying how friendly and kind they were. But these weren’t enough to make Napier okay. One research participant explained:“[Napier is] like a prison. But really the people in Napier is good people…trying to help, but the problem is not from them. They are not ruling us. The government does.”He believed that the government had put him in a place like prison, and kindness on the part of site staff couldn’t alter the damaging effects of that. Probably the most significant change to have occurred since the High Court ruling is the introduction of a 90-day time limit on placement at Napier. Previously, placement there was indefinite, as it is in detention, and, as in detention, this added another layer to the trauma of Napier. It was a dark tunnel with no end in sight. As mentioned in the report, the introduction of the time limit really did change that – it put light at theendof the tunnel. Again and again, people referred to the end that was in sight:“I’ve trained my mind to think ‘it’s just 65days so just keeping going, keep existing, and to live one day at a time.”They were treading water, living in limbo, and the only thing that made this bearable was that it would end. Before Napier, people had been in asylum hotels, where the conditions were often awful and which shared with Napier many problematic features – asylum hotels are institutional and large scale and restrict agency to structure daily life. On leaving Napier, they’d be sent to dispersal accommodation – a shared house or flat in a community. They could live more normally. People who had lost everything, some of whom had survived torture and trafficking, experienced Napier as a trauma to be endured before they could, once again, start to live. And people would still plead for the time to be shorter:“Just take a few days from those 3 months. I’m not complaining, it’s fine, but 3 months is still 3 months.”It is not acceptable to knowingly subject people seeking safety to further suffering. The fact that such suffering is time limited offers no justification. Napier is emblematic of a relatively new form of asylum accommodation for the UK – large-scale, institutional, in out-of-town, detention-like camps. The government just doubled-down on their plans to make sites like Napier prolific. Our research adds to the growing, and compelling,evidenceof just how damaging this kind of institutional accommodation is, and how fundamental the problems with it are. What is needed is not minor tweaking, or modifications. It is a fundamentally different approach. We need communities not camps. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Reflecting on marathon training and the journey of those who were uprooted,03-Apr-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/london-marathon-ana/,"This year at the London Marathon, JRS UK has 5 dedicated runners on the team who are taking on this challenge to support refugees. One of them is Ana, who is running together with her friend Eileen on the team. We recently chatted with Ana to hear more about what motivated her to run the full marathon and what her fundraising would look like for these three weeks leading up to the race. What made you decide to run the London Marathon for JRS? My friend Eileen asked me to! I didn’t want to do a marathon, ever, because the half marathons I did were enough. And in fact, I moved from half marathons to triathlons because they were easier to train for. And really, running for three or four hours is a killer! But Eileen asked me and I couldn’t say no, because she’s my friend and it is for supporting refugees, which is a good cause. So with both things together, I thought: I will do it with you! I also feel that refugees have a very hard life. In today’s society, in my experience —not everybody, obviously— some people really think that we shouldn’t be open to refugees because they’re going to take away all our services. And it’s scary when you meet people who think like this, because nobody chooses to suddenly be a refugee, as if they think one day ‘I will leave everything behind, then I’m going to some country where I don’t speak the language.’ It’s really quite dire, otherwise they wouldn’t do it. So it really does annoy me when people think or suggest that refugees are “going to come, do nothing and take all of our money”. It does annoy me, because I find it very short-sighted, very inhuman. And I do wonder, for some of these people, how would they feel if they were the refugees, if they had to flee from their countries. Nobody chooses to uproot themselves like that. With the current government’s plan to send people to Rwanda, I mean, what?! We should be really helping refugees! Anyway, it upsets me when people want to treat refugees badly.   SUPPORT ANA’S FUNDRAISER   You recently shared a reflection on the tragedy of migrant boat shipwreck in Italy, which motivated you to keep on going with your training and to keep on running for the cause of supporting refugees. Can you talk more about this? When I am in pain—yesterday I was in pain, my feet were hurting, my legs were hurting—I was thinking: I am hurting because I chose to go running. But a refugee has their whole body, their whole soul hurting—everything is hurting. Emotionally they are broken. Also, I was going to run and get home, I was going to have a nice shower, and eat—they don’t know when they are going to arrive, and they don’t knowwherethey are going to arrive. So yes, it motivates me, when I am in pain and I thought: this is nothing compared to what they would have to go through. So, it really motivates me to carry on. Sometimes it’s difficult to have to start walking, but it puts one into the mind that how little we suffer compared to them. And it motivates me to run for them, to do this little bitforthem, really, because I can’t do any more. I wish I could do more, but I can’t. Thank you so much for sharing, Ana! Do you have any fundraising plans or tips for other runners? What I realised is that you really have to telleverybodyyou know! Everybody, and not be shy! Because if I don’t share my fundraising campaign with people, the possibility of them donating wouldn’t be there. And also, to tell people if you cannot give money, you can always put a comment. But the thing is to share with as many as you know! I am going to make a LinkedIn post (I don’t use Facebook) for all of my network, because they don’t know I am doing this. I am also going to send it to everyone I know over email. The other thing is to post it several times, not just once. Because if I post only once, people might want to donate, but get distracted and forget. So, my plan is to post one this week, and then one each week in the following 3 weeks before the race—just to encourage people to donate. A huge thank you to Ana for being a part of our team of marathon runners this year! Below are some lovely photos Ana recently took on her short training run.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"What we know now, and what we’re still asking",29-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/what-we-know-now-and-what-were-still-asking/,"Yesterday, the government’s‘Illegal Migration Bill’passed Committee Stage in the House of Commons. Introduced by the Home Secretary at the start of March, the purported aim of the Bill is to stop small boats arrivals and keep the Prime Minister’s promise that “anyone entering this country illegally will be detained and swiftly removed.” This Bill would be a humanitarian catastrophe, and it would do nothing good. It has so far passed through parliament with remarkable speed, and the committee stage of the Bill in particular was truncated. Normally, at this point, a separate, cross-party committee of MPs takes days to scrutinise a Bill line-by-line, and possible amendments, in detail before the Bill returns to the whole house. This time, it occurred over two days in the House of Commons main chamber, which allowed for a lot less scrutiny, but many more theatrical speeches. When the Bill was first released, we published ablog outlining what we knew then and key questions moving forward. We’ve updated this below with developments from the last few weeks. To recap what we know so far, if enacted the Bill would mean: This Bill has huge implications for human lives, and for our whole society. It requires serious attention, and it is troubling that it’s not receiving it. We will continue to keep watch. Here are some key questionswe are still asking: This is all happening alongside the growth of‘quasi-detention’and detention in increasingly unclear circumstances – the government has just announced it’s procuring more disused military sites to open camps like Napier barracks. Today, JRS UK have released a new report,‘Napier Barracks: the inhumane reality’, whichshines a light onto the experiences of people placed in the asylum camp at the disused Napier Barracks in Kent. The report gives insight into how destructive the expanded use of immigration detention and quasi-detention would be. The Bill is still in flux as it passes through parliament. In practice, if enacted, this legislation is very likely to lead to many people trapped in limbo here, unremovable, but also with no route to gain recognition as refugees in the UK or otherwise regularise their status. It is very troubling. We will continue to stand in solidarity with refugees and demand an end to this attack on the very principle of asylum, and call for a just and humane asylum process.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"In celebration of World Poetry Day, March 2023",21-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/in-celebration-of-world-poetry-day-march-2023/,"The Open Writing Space organised by JRS during the COVID-19 pandemic was a fantastic opportunity to come together with other friends and work on improving our writing skills. It was an opportunity to reflect on our shared humanity even at a time of such immense global challenges. The interactive writing sessions helped me to overcome the pains of social isolation and the trauma of striving ahead without any hint of Government support. Ultimately, I derived strength from the assurance of a supportive and loving community within the JRS. Ben, contributing author & JRS UK friend During the pandemic we had to move all our work – including refugee activities – online. It was important for us to continue offering refugee activities – alongside the rest of our emergency response services –to provide an online space for refugee friends to meet and support each other. This was especially needed – as we all know, lockdown was a very isolating time – particularly for refugee friends. At the start of the pandemic, I met Laila Sumpton, a poet-editor-performer who has worked with charities and other refugee rights groups before, and I knew instantly that a writing group would be popular at JRS. We started talking about how this could work online and how it could be easily accessible to refugee friends. This involved reaching out to refugee friends to teach them how to use Zoom and providing access to internet data so they could participate. We had eight sessions online with Laila. For two hours every week, Laila took us on a journey of writing, teaching us about different genres of writing – letter-writing, recipes, and short stories, for example. She set different creative tasks such as writing to our future selves, our experiences of lockdown, and creating stories and histories for pieces of art. At the end of every week, Laila would set homework for the group to continue developing their writing skills. Some of our friends do not have email addresses, so we primarily used WhatsApp as a means of communicating, to send back our written pieces and receive feedback. At the end of the twelve weeks, we had produced a number of poems and prose pieces, which were collected into a book:Home is a feeling not a place. Refugee friends who participated were given copies for themselves and to give to loved ones, and thebook of poetry is available for supporters on our website. At various times these poems have been on display in the JRS Shop and in other places around the Centre – a new colleague told me about how when she came in for her interview, a refugee friend showed her the poem he had written. Not only did she remark on the poem being well-written and striking itself, but on how the refugee voice is literally part of JRS, on our walls and staircases, giving identity to the Centre. Having this very concrete output of the project was very encouraging for our friends – it’s tangible proof of the work they’ve put in, of their talents and skills, a way to share their voices with others. With many of our other activities we also look for tangible project outcomes – whether it be a recipe book from Community Kitchen, or performing dramatic monologues at the JRS Advent Service. Since the first writing group our subsequent writing groups have  all taken on different focuses – formal writing (think letter and emailing writing), creative writing & dramatic monologues to be performed, and so on. Our writing groups have become one of the staples of our refugee activities programme – they are a great way to give friends a platform to have their voices heard, to be creative in their writing and express themselves, to believe in themselves and build their confidence. At the time, Han, a refugee friend of JRS UK and contributing author of the book said:‘Writing is a powerful instrument to communicate and engage with another individual. I hope this book will leave a lasting impression of the powerful voices of the muted people in society, that it will open new avenues of thoughts and ideas which were never considered before.’ This World Poetry Day, why not order a copy ofHome is a feeling not a place? It was a joy to be a part of, and I hope you find joy in it too. The paperback collection,‘Home is a feeling not a place’, is available for £10 on the JRS UK website. All proceeds go to the work of JRS UK in supporting those we accompany in immigration detention, and those living in forced destitution due to the UK asylum system.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Running the London Marathon for people who have had to flee,08-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/running-the-london-marathon-for-people-who-have-had-to-flee/,"This year at the London Marathon, JRS UK has 5 dedicated runners on the team who are taking on this challenge to support refugees. One of them is our very own Communications Manager, Eileen. We recently chatted with Eileen to hear more about why she decided to run the marathon and what her journey preparing for it has been.  Very adventurously I did the Couch to 5K challenge and felt very proud of myself – what a great achievement! I tried to keep up a regular 6K just to stay fit. I was out running one Sunday morning and found myself unexpectedly in the midst of the Royal Parks Half-Marathon Run. I could see what an amazing atmosphere and event it was, and it inspired me. I was listening to Desert Island discs at the time, and guess what the second disc was? It was “Come On Eileen!”. So I thought, yes, I’m sure with preparation and training, I can do this. I started training and it was very ambitious for me, because I’m not really a runner. One of the things I found the hardest was finding the time in my busy schedule, because it takes a lot of time to do the long runs. The training is quite demanding in every way, and so is the fundraising. I don’t really like asking people for money. But it’s not for me, it’s for refugee friends—so thinking this way helps. The fundraising consists mainly in talking a lot about the work of Jesuit Refugee Service, the lives of refugees, and the issues they face, and I know that JRS really does make a huge difference to their lives.  SUPPORT EILEEN’S FUNDRAISER  I was doing very well and then I had a knee injury from doing sprints, which seemed like a good idea at the time! So whilst sprinting in very cold weather, I really hurt my knee. I had to take off three weeks for recovery and I had to go to physio and that was very expensive! But the physiotherapist was very good, and he’s got me running again—I’m now running every day. They’re shorter runs until I’m completely sure of my knee, but so far so good… In terms of training, the injury put me back, and that was hard. Psychologically, it was hard not being able to run knowing that time was passing. That was quite pressurized because time felt very short already. So then to lose three weeks was upsetting. But it’s great to see many people out and running. It looks like the whole world is preparing for the marathon at the moment! When I am running, I think of people who have to run away from danger, from their home, from persecution—and how hard that must be. And when I’m running and I’m finding it hard because I’m tired or it hurts, I think of them. I think of people who have had to flee. And actually, that helps me pray, because I pray for refugees every day. I ask God to help me serve in my work and to really work well in service of refugees, who are the people that we’re working for at JRS. Ahead of the marathon day, I’m nervous that I’ll get another injury and I’m worried that I won’t be fast enough. I’m worried that I won’t reach my fundraising ambition. But apart from that, I’m not worried. I’m enjoying it!  A huge thank you to Eileen and our 4 other marathon runners of 2023!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Embracing Equity in the darkest of places,07-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/embracing-equity-in-the-darkest-of-places/,"For International Women’s Day this year, we’re invited to‘Embrace Equity’: to imagine a world where difference is valued and celebrated. A world where we can forge women’s equality, raise awareness of women’s strength, and come together to fight for equality. It can feel almost impossible to join with such powerful and positive global messaging toembrace equityin a hostile immigration system which doesn’t recognise humanity, let alone equity. For the 563 women who suffered through the rigours and indignities of Immigration Detention in 2021, its hard on the face of it to embrace equity. “I do feel it was very unfair, I was detained because my appeal for asylum was refused, however, the Home Office failed to notify me or my solicitor of that refusal, which led to me getting detained because I had exhausted my rights to further appeal, but by not notifying me of their decision I believe they took away that right, as you know, that detention led to me being transferred from one detention centre to another back and forth without any consideration, I’m at the point now that though I am physically alright, I am always anxious, about when would be the day it will happen again, am always expecting for someone to knock at my door, stop me in the middle of the street or detain me at the reporting site again, it’s always an ongoing fear.” JRS friend in detention The JRS UK Detention Outreach Team visit the predominantly male detention centres at Heathrow each week. The Sahara Unit, situated within Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre (IRC), is a Short-term Holding Unit for women at Heathrow. The Sahara Unit has  capacity for 18 women in shared rooms of two. As a Short-term Holding Unit, woman areusuallyheld for between 5-7 days, before being released into the community, relocated to another detention facility, or sometimes deported. JRS’s Detention Outreach Manager Naomi Blackwell, visits women in detention regularly, she said “Many of the women I meet in detention report that they are confused, many are tearful and distressed. These women are not a danger to society, most are released back into the community, begging the question: ‘what is the point of this expensive disruptive process’? “Women still suffer on release and say that the trauma of detention remains with them. Women who are victims of trafficking will also be detained here and struggle to access legal advice, everyone should have prompt face-to-face access to legal advice. We don’t have the capacity to provide that, sometimes all I can do is to listen and just give them a hug, which is a very small comfort. I always wish we could do more.” Inside the Sahara Unit the shared rooms are small, though the living area is large, with exercise machines, a pool table, a massage chair, sofas and television, computers, books, a small kitchen, and laundry area. There is no natural light in the communal area. There is no immediately accessible outdoor space, and detainees have to wait for officers to escort them for fresh air. There’s limited personal space, or time to be alone. And yet, amidst all this darkness and confusion, there is incredible peer-support. Women championing women, and fighting together for equity, which is summed up beautifully and poignantly by a message left in Portuguese on a table in the Sahara Unit, it said: O amor de Deus te trouxe aqui pra te dizer qu nao é o fim. O seu futuro está nas maos daquele que tudo pode. Acredite querida. “The love of God brought you here to tell you that this is not the end.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,What we know so far,07-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/what-we-know-so-far/,"Today, the Home Secretary made a statement introducing the government’s proposed “Illegal Migration” Bill. The purported aim of the bill is to stop small boats arrivals and keep the Prime Minister’s promise that “anyone entering this country illegally will be detained and swiftly removed.” Clearly, this will be a cruel and inhumane piece of legislation aiming to further reduce access to protection and punish refugees for how they are able to travel. At its worst, it could amount to an attempt to dismantle the asylum system altogether. There is still much to learn because, as the Home Secretary herself admitted, her statement was relatively thin on detail, and some of what she said had already been made public. What we do now know about the Bill is: As will already be evident, this leaves a lot unclear, and points towards a lot of possibilities to look out for.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,World Book Day 2023,02-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/world-book-day-2023/,"For World Book Day on Friday 3rdMarch, we’ve asked colleagues at JRS UK to share books they found thought-provoking, changed their perspectives, or taught them something new. Reading is a great way of encountering new ideas and seeing the world from a new perspective. This is especially important in a world where news comes thick and fast, and with little time to stop and think. To this end, colleagues have shared books written by authors with different experiences and life stories, as well as a mixture of non-fiction, fiction and graphic novels, which explore refugee and migration issues deeply. In case you’re a voracious reader and get through these quickly, we’ve also asked colleagues to share what their reading next! Have you read any of these books? What books would you recommend? We’d love to know! Kate Evans is a graphic novelist and volunteered at the Calais Jungle before it was demolished. She created this graphic novel from what she witnessed, and the stories and experiences refugees shared with her. The book documents her experience of volunteering in the camp, interactions with French police and their brutality, and the conditions in which refugees were surviving. Importantly, this book captures the humanity of the individual refugees Kate met at the camp and the joy and hope they carry. I’m a visual person so the imagery of the graphic novel has really stuck with me. The start of the novel shows imagery of the fences used to prevent movement of refugees that are being made by woven lace, the historical industry of Calais. The fences/lace is used throughout the novel as the borders of the story board. I remember the book wonderfully contrasting the anger of forcing such brutality and inhumane conditions on people with the hospitality, joy and respect that refugees maintain in the harshest of conditions. The book has made me more appreciative and understanding of the experiences our refugee friends face before arrival to the UK and has supported my learning and practice of trauma-informed working. And what’s next on your “to-read” list? I’m currently reading ‘Tenants: The People on the Frontline of Britain’s Housing Emergency’ by Vicky Spratt.  I have never read another book quite like If Not Now When by Primo Levi. It’s a story of resistance by Jewish partisans first against the German army and then making their way across central Europe as the war ended. Some of it is real, none of it is sugar coated, and somehow out of the horror and inhumanity there’s a genuine sense of hope. Sometimes, uncomfortably, that hope springs from the exhilaration of vengeance. It is not a book about forgiveness and is all the more important because it challenges our assumptions about forgiveness.  I haven’t gone through the same horrors that our parents did or what many of our refugee friends go through, but the book has challenged me to think about how one would respond in those circumstances. At JRS we are genuinely lucky that we have the chance to offer solidarity in place of judgement. And what’s next on your “to-read” list? I’m hoping to read Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie next.  Exit West, by Mohsin Hamid, tells the story of two refugees, a young couple, whose lives are endangered and upended when war tears apart their country, as they travel to Europe and then America in a near future setting. This book really brings out the precarity of being a refugee and living in a situation of forced migration – risks that must be taken, struggle to find home, uncertainty about what home is. It also places this in the wider context of migration, and asks important questions about migration, refuge, and being human. And what’s next on your “to-read” list? At the moment, I’m reading Ursula Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness – another book that challenges me to think about the world differently.  I was lent a personal copy of this book about 4 years ago by someone I had only just met. The book is a collection of 21 essays from British Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic writers and artists who come together to explore what it means to be a person of colour in contemporary Britain. It’s both powerful and funny and I found it the perfect antidote to the anti-immigration rhetoric we hear used by the government or the media. I was fascinated by the different stories all with common themes around identity and belonging. The writers explore why they stay in the UK and what it means to be ‘other’ in a country that doesn’t seem to want them or truly accept them. What struck me was some of their experiences of visiting countries where their parents or grandparents were born were often not dissimilar, in other words the writers experiences were of being treated as ‘other’ in these countries too. The book resonated with me and my own, often confused, sense of identity and belonging. Working at JRS of course means I’m meeting people from all over the world on a daily basis. I would like to explore more the idea of individuals having multiple identities and the advantages of acknowledging and accepting this. And what’s next on your “to-read” list? I have just started reading ‘The Colony’ by Audrey Magee. It is a novel set on a remote island off the west coast of Ireland. It’s set, during the peak of the Troubles, in 1979 and charts Anglo-Irish history, in particular the preservation of the Irish language. It is an incredibly thought-provoking book about the past and colonialism and I’m looking forward to reading it!  This book is a comprehensive journey through the history of immigration to the British Isles, from pre-the Roman occupation up until 2005. A mammoth task, thoroughly referenced, and, whilst touching on serious issues manages to weave in an often wry humour, and due to detailed human insights and anecdotes, manages not be boring or laboured. I have cringed at the “Little Englander” attitudes and our historic ignorance of other cultures, along with a puffed-up nationalism which takes pride in achievements which owe much to hard-working immigrants. I loved little details like learning about the genesis of such British institutions like Marks & Spencer and Tesco, both founded by Jewish immigrants. And so much more. This is a rich tome of history, there is something for everyone who is interested in migration. This book has helped me to understand that we are all migrants at some point in our precedence or existence. And what’s next on your “to-read”list? Into the Arms of Strangers – Stories of the Kindertransport by Mark Jonathan Harris & Deborah Oppenheimer  Dreamland follows the story of a young girl called Chance who is trying to navigate her way through the chaotic hand that life has dealt her. Set in the slightly dystopian, not too distant future, Dreamland explores life at the margins of society as inequality and political extremism take hold. Yet love and hope still find ways to endure. Although you could describe Dreamland as dystopian fiction, it doesn’t feel so out of reach as the backdrop of the book is the result of current UK polices stretched to their, not so irrational, limits. A product of her chaotic life, Chance is a warm and likeable character who is making the best of the challenges she faces and who I instantly rooted for from the beginning. The book deals with some incredibly heavy and difficult topics – such as poverty, inequality, addiction and loss – yet still finds a way to show that community, hope and human connection can be present even in the hardest of times. I genuinely didn’t want this book to end, and the plot twist hit me hard. Dreamland depicts a future where some current UK policies – especially around housing, immigration and the climate emergency – have been left to run their course. It is a reminder that we have a responsibility to advocate for meaningful change within society for the benefit of all people, and to prevent the exploitation of social division that ultimately pushes people further to the margins of society. And what’s next on your “to-read” list? I am currently reading Harlem Shuffle by Colson Whitehead. His books, especially The Underground Railroad and The Nickel Boys, are some of the best books I’ve ever read.  Against Borders is a passionate manifesto for border abolition, arguing that we must transform society and our relationships to one another, and build a world in which everyone has the freedom to move and to stay. If you’re looking for an introduction to the politics of borders/border abolition, then this is a very accessible read. The book applies police/prison abolitionist methods, politics, and language to argue why we need to be rid of borders as a concept entirely – rather than just reform them. It offers practical ‘non-reformists reforms’ that undermine the logic that upholds border regimes and moves us closer to a world without them. I particularly enjoyed the part of a book which imagined dystopian and utopian world’s without borders, dependent on the path we take. It was really helpful and original. The book offers a good mixture of theory and practical steps that those organising in the migrant rights sector can take. It reaffirmed my strong belief that all deserve the right to move and to stay, and my passion for resisting the powers that try extremely hard to prevent that. And what’s next on your “to-read” list? ‘Hostile Environment’, and everything else onVerso’s list! [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"On the first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, Britain’s choices on refugee policy stand in sharp relief",20-Feb-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/on-the-first-anniversary-of-the-invasion-of-ukraine-britains-choices-on-refugee-policy-stand-in-sharp-relief/,"One year on from the invasion of Ukraine, I recall the shocked horror I felt as the catastrophic events there first began to unfold, and I think of its ongoing impact. In particular, many people have been displaced by the war, forced to escape their homes, some still struggling to find safe haven, all looking on in horror. Our society has responded with deep compassion towards them, and actually galvanised a deeply anti-refugee government to do something to help. In a context where so many bear similar burdens to Ukrainian refugees, this should give us hope. It should also show us what is possible. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, Ireflected onthe outpouring of public sympathy and compassion towards Ukrainian refugees in the UK and across Europe. Families and individuals desperately wanted to welcome those in need of sanctuary from the war, and in many cases were eager to open their homes to them. I also wrote about how the UK government’s response was more complex and left much to be desired. The Homes for Ukraine scheme did open a route by which some Ukrainians could travel to the UK safely, and without fear of facing legal penalties. However, this was happening in a wider legal and policy context, as the government prepared to pass theNationality and Borders Billthat would punish refugees for travelling in the only way available to them, and the government’s response to Ukrainian refugees was hampered by its cruel commitment to punishing refugees for travelling without prior authorisation. It refused to follow EU countries in waiving visas for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary, and many struggled to get to the UK as a result. A year on, as the war in Ukraine continues, the public policy landscape towards refugees in the UK has predictably deteriorated further: since the invasion of Ukraine, the government has passed the Nationality and Borders Act and made plans to forcibly and permanently transferpeople seeking asylum to Rwandaand vastly increase the use of immigration detention, which subjects people to deep trauma. The Home Secretary has compared people seeking sanctuary to an “invasion” and refused to apologise for her language even whenchallengedon it by a Joan Salter, a Holocaust survivor warning of its potential dangerous consequences. Nor is this anti-refugee hostility confined to the sphere of public policy: On 10thFebruary,members of the far rightled violent protests outside a hotel accommodating asylum seekers in Merseyside. Joan Salter’s warning that dehumanising language has dire consequences seems all too prescient in light of this. The situation feels bleak. Yet, at the same time, we have continued to see compassion, welcome, and solidarity towards Ukrainians from communities across the UK. Over the last year, the British public, among many others, has responded to Ukrainians seeking sanctuary with an outpouring of sympathy, welcoming them into British communities. In the face of the horror in Ukraine, we have seen a strong and widespread desire to welcome refugees. Communities across the UK have welcomed over 100,000 Ukrainians, under a scheme that, in England, relies on individuals opening up their homes to make it work at all. Here there is a deep hospitality towards the stranger. It reminds us that the anti-refugee protestors do not represent British communities, but that kindness and welcome is found there. And at JRS, we see such kindness on a daily basis, from those who host refugees and many others who give and volunteer to support them.  In the hosting of refugees, Ukrainians and others, on the one hand, and violently protesting against them, on the other, we have two starkly different attitudes to human beings in need – one of support and welcome, the other of dehumanisation and destruction. Either could shape public policy. In the response to Ukraine, we see government policy that has, however imperfectly, bowed to public pressure towards the first attitude. Though there is still much more that should be done for Ukrainian refugees, this does begin to show us what public policy towards refugees could look like, and it shows us that there are communities eager to see such a change. The violence, and destruction of people’s lives that began a year ago with the invasion of Ukraine, is unabated. People continue to be displaced by the war, and those who escaped a year ago remain exiled from home. And this is happening in so many other parts of the world as well. But another world is possible. And we can play a part in building it. We can stand in solidarity with the displaced, but that requires a very new approach. Photo: ©cbcew.org/Mazur [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Running the London Marathon 2023 to support refugees,20-Feb-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/francis-running-the-london-marathon-2023-to-support-refugees/,"The 2023 London Marathon is on Sunday 23rdApril. This year, we are grateful to have 5 dedicated runners on Team JRS UK who are raising money through this challenge to support refugees! One of the runners on the team is Francis. Francis told us that he decided to run the London Marathon after people he found inspiring convinced him to take on the challenge. This will be his very first marathon, and ‘probably last, but running is starting to grow on me but one thing at a time.’ He chose to support refugees through running for JRS UK because some of his friends work here, so he knew the money he raises ‘would go directly and fully to the people who need it the most.’ Francis is currently training and mentally preparing for the big day in April. In addition to running, he is reading a very informative book called theNon-Runner’s Marathon Trainer(1998) by David Whitsett. He is also listening to some running podcasts by Steve Scullion, which he has shared with other JRS runners on the team.  SUPPORT FRANCIS’S FUNDRAISER  The money Francis raises will go directly to supporting destitute refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. JRS UK relies on donations from individuals to support our work with destitute asylum seekers assisting refugees with their basic needs. We provide regular hardship grants to enable people to travel across London to access essential services, to attend immigration, medical and legal appointments, and to buy everyday essential items they may need. We provide a monthly toiletries pack with essential items such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, face masks and sanitary towels. Hardship grants and toiletry packs are given to those asylum seekers who do not receive benefits or asylum support. We also offer small grants for educational needs and sometimes assist with exceptional needs. A huge thank you to Francis and our 4 other marathon runners of 2023!

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Young Uruguayan visitors at JRS UK,13-Feb-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/young-uruguayan-visitors-at-jrs-uk/,"At the beginning of February, we were visited by two sixth form groups from Colegio Seminario, a Jesuit school in Montevideo, Uruguay. A first, smaller, group of seven visited us after attending a Model United Nations meeting in the Netherlands. We were then visited by 27 of their classmates who had just spent two weeks at Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit school in Lancashire with whom they have long-standing ties. We are very honoured that the students and teachers made time to visit us at JRS UK to learn about the asylum system in the UK and the work we do. The young people articulated powerful contributions to our lively exchange around the issues facing refugees in our current climate. They empathised with the difficulties faced by those who are displaced by war or persecution, and the hardship it entails to lose your community and your home, full of fear and concern about the future, often without ID and documentation. Together, we considered the differences in our own associations with refugees and asylum seekers, the highly flammable language we see used by the government and in press coverage, and in official legal definitions. The students discussed the power of language, and how the way it is used can affect how people are seen and treated, how misinformation can lead to scapegoating and, as we’ve seen in recent months, very real and dangerous attacks on people seeking safety. The students also had questions about the nuances of the legal definitions and who therefore is able to receive protection. We read testimonies from our refugee friends and the challenges that many of our refugee friends face, such as destitution, homelessness, forced separation from communities of support, and immigration detention. The students were shocked by the culture of hostility and disbelief those who arrive in the UK are met with.  The Seminario students questioned how someone could be kept in destitution for decades, why refugees are needlessly asked to move around the country, and the lack of support available for asylum seekers. One student reflected: “what strikes me is how the legal system, something created to protect, does quite the opposite.” In contrast, the students spoke about how, throughoutits history, Uruguay has experienced massive waves of immigration from all around the world, specifically from theEuropean continent, and today 90–95% of the Uruguayan population hasEuropean ancestry. In contrast to the UK, it is probably one of the easiest countries in the world in which to immigrate and obtain residency. Following the outbreak of war in Syria, they welcomed many Syrians with a positive reception, integration and outcomes. Recently they have welcomed many Venezuelans and Cubans, which, the students say, has enriched their culture even further, though it is often hard for professionals to practise their profession in the new country due to differing legal systems, and they therefore have to take on less skilled work than they previously carried out. Considering the differences in welcome and asylum processes in the UK and Uruguay, the students reflected on the importance of accompaniment – a core JRS value – using their own volunteering experiences as a starting point. Specifically, in this Montevideo school, the students have the opportunity to commit to volunteer work on Saturdays in a structured way, whereby each year in a gradual process, each group becomes responsible for a different service. This aims at helping them in their growth in maturity and responsibility and fosters an open and committed attitude towards those in need. The services the young people work in include construction of housing, parish-based soup kitchens, and accompanying the elderly. The students identified accompaniment as a central part of all of their volunteering work and hospitality. It “makes you feel human,” one student reflected, “it is important to show people that they have a place, that people care for them and don’t just see them as a problem to be solved.” We discussed how this can help with wellbeing and confidence, especially in an environment which is purposefully designed to be hostile and to render people invisible. Sitting and having a coffee with someone, chatting about hobbies or a favourite football team, however small an action, can “make people feel human. It’s a process of humanisation, dignification.” “I believe loneliness is one of the worst feelings, so that’s why accompaniment is crucial, and equally as important as donating, is accompanying. You can accompany by just talking and making others feel human.” We were struck by the sensitive, mature and caring attitude of these young visitors from Uruguay and conclude that much is thanks to their opportunity to volunteer in a stable, structured way from a young age. One student astutely observed that voluntary work and accompaniment “is important not only for the person you are accompanying but also for you…. [accompaniment] helps to construct community and a sense of home.” TheRed Jesuita con Migrantes, a network of the Society of Jesus which seeks to collaborate at the continental, regional, and interprovincial levels in Latin America to support migrants and those in situations of refuge or displacement have moved into the Colegio Seminario school grounds, and we look forward to hearing about students’ experiences of this going forward. We would like to thank Colegio Seminario again for their visit and for being so engaged and eager to take part in discussion, and for the messages of encouragement they left with us. They were encouraged and amazed by the fight of JRS to accompany, serve and advocate for so many despite receiving no help from the government, and the students have expressed their intention to speak about these issues with their classmates back in Uruguay, and to keep learning more. One student commented with the clear-sighted vision of youth: “We have the hands to make our world better day by day”.  [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK & Asylum Welcome talk about the impacts of immigration detention at the Oxford University Catholic Chaplaincy,13-Feb-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/jrs-uk-asylum-welcome-talk-about-the-impacts-of-immigration-detention-at-the-oxford-university-catholic-chaplaincy/,"JRS’ Sophie Cartwright, Senior Policy Officer, and Victoria Firth, Community Engagement Officer, joined Hari Reed of Asylum Welcome to talk at the Oxford University Catholic Chaplaincy about the use of immigration detention in the UK and a campaign against the reopening of Campsfield IRC in Oxfordshire. Students, Chaplaincy staff, Oxford residents and university academics participated in a discussion covering the growing use of immigration detention in the asylum system, conditions within immigration removal centres and their impact on health and well-being, and the wider political context for renewed interest in Campsfield. What is immigration detention? Immigration detention is the holding of people in prison-like conditions, ostensibly for the purpose of immigration control, such as facilitating removal from the UK.  Immigration detention In the UK, is indefinite and the decision to detain does not go before a judge. Our detention outreach work at Harmondsworth and Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centres at Heathrow has demonstrated time and time again the lasting and damaging impact of detention on mental and physical health, and on one’s sense of self, even beyond the time held in detention. Knowing the harmful and long-lasting impacts of detention, we stand wholeheartedly withThe Coalition to Keep Campsfield Closed. Immigration detention is antithetical to the dignity of the human person and is ineffective as an administrative procedure, and must be opposed. In short, as the coalition says: “immigration detention is not the answer.” How much time do we have to stop Campsfield reopening? Campsfield House, six miles north of Oxford, was originally used as a youth detention centre but was converted into an Immigration Detention Centre in 1993. It was open for 25 years, closing in 2018 amidst a general decline in the use of detention. In June 2022, the Home Office announced its intention to reopen Campsfield House, with an aim to reopen at the end of 2023. It was a lively discussion, one that really spoke to the necessity of talking and sharing experiences. Those attending had a range of knowledge of immigration detention – some had never heard of it, whilst others had participated in monitoring boards, some have had experiences of hosting or supporting refugee friends who have been in and out of detention. A key topic of conversation was the worsening of conditions in immigration detention over the years, and people showed great concern about how welfare and wellbeing would be tended to. What can we do to campaign agaisnt the reopening of Campsfield? How can I learn more about immigration detention? JRS UK have signed theChange.org petition to Keep Campsfield Closed. If you’re in the Oxford area and are able to give more time to the campaign, you canget further involved in a number of ways, including by joining their mailing list, writing letters to your MP, or joining their next meeting. You can read more about what immigration detention is, as well as its impact, in our 2020 reportDetained and Dehumanised, which is a piece of work based off 24 interviews with people with lived experiences of detention. We also have a monthly “Praying with Detainees” newsletter, with reflections from people currently/previously held in detention, volunteers, and staff, and share news about developments in the use of detention on our website. If you’re in London and are interested in volunteering with us, please doget in touch. We are always in need of social visitors who accompany people held in detention and provide some much needed friendship. Other organisations, such as AVID (Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees) and BID (Bail for Immigration Detainees) are worth looking into and share research and commentaries too. Events like this one – raising awareness and sharing opportunities to get involved – are so important today amidst growing government hostility and planned increases to the detention estate. We’d like to thank Hari Reed for her input, and Fr Matthew, Alvea and Fr William for their help setting up the talk and inviting guests to attend. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"Lord, were you there when I became a trafficked victim?",03-Feb-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/lord-were-you-there-when-i-became-a-trafficked-victim/,"On the first day of this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting – the theme of which was ‘Cooperation in a Fragmented World’ –  Aljazeera published the headline : “Richest 1% bag two-thirds of $42 trillion in new wealth.” According to research done by Oxfam International, the richest people in the world have acquired two-thirds of all the world’s wealth since 2020. In the days since, I’ve been wondering how those who participated in the WEF meeting plan to address the world’s most pressing global challenges, how they will find ways and means to benefit the poorest peoples on earth.  I’ve also pondered how such great imbalances can exist in the first place, especially alongside the stories of the people I have encountered in my time volunteering in Detention. LORD, WERE YOU THERE WHEN I BECAME A TRAFFICKED VICTIM? Vietnam has been under Communist rule since 1975. Basic human rights are highly restricted and its citizens have little protection or support – especially if they come from poor families. The people work hard and mostly make food products, but they are not able to sell them – or if they do manage to sell food, it often isn’t enough to meet their family’s needs. Wages are too low to cover the basic needs of many families. Poverty, sickness, unemployment, debt, and fatal diseases are the frequent topics that the men I’ve met in detention talk about. In other words, their memories of their homeland are very painful. LORD, WERE YOU THERE AS I LAY IN BED AT NIGHT CRYING AND LONELY IN A FOREIGN LAND? How do these Vietnamese men end up being trafficked? Those I have accompanied have told me about gangsters who threaten them because they cannot pay their debts. They risk their lives to go abroad, following false promises from traffickers of a better life, where they can earn money to help their families. Many borrow money to embark on hazardous journeys from Vietnam to China, Russia, Poland – by plane, lorries, on foot through jungles walking night and day – to France and then to the UK where their passports are taken and they are left homeless and empty-handed. Many are taken toCannabisfarms. Enslaved, trapped, exploited. They are eventually arrested, put in prison and ultimately detained – identified as perpetrators, not victims, of crime. With limited, or often no English, those I have accompanied feel confused and isolated in detention. If they are unable to have access to an interpreter it can become impossible to navigate the system, to access justice and they face the possibility of deportation. LORD, WERE YOU THERE WHEN SOMEONE HELPED ME FIND MY VOICE? I have been a volunteer with JRS for the past 6 years. I feel I have been sent by God to the UK, to serve my people in a foreign land. I have met so many young people and feel pained by how they have been treated and continue to be treated. They suffer isolation and depression, they feel voiceless and powerless, they are treated as criminals. Most of them do not speak English. In volunteering, my mission is to help these young men have a voice and find hope. I strive to accompany them so that they know they have someone who will walk with them, without fear of judgement or condemnation. I look at each one and say, ‘He is my brother’. ST JOSPHINE, REMEMBER AND INTERCEDE FOR US. In February, we commemorate the feast of St. Josephine Bakhita. St Josephine Bakhita, you were a victim of human trafficking, kidnapped and sold into slavery. Through your intercession and on our behalf, we ask God to strengthen those who are victims of trafficking and slavery and who feel desperate and lonely.  We pray for those who are living in uncertainty and fear, waiting for years for their legal documents to be granted to them. In solidarity we stand with them, supporting them in whatever way we can.  Compassionate God, we plead for them. Amen. Sr Vui is a volunteer with the Detention Outreach team. As a Vietnamese National she has a special ministry supporting Vietnamese men who find themselves detained, often after experiencing modern slavery and human trafficking. This reflection is from February’s Praying with Detainees, a monthly newsletter with prayers and reflections from our work in immigration detention.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,A catchup with the JRS UK Community Kitchen,30-Jan-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/a-catchup-with-the-jrs-uk-community-kitchen/,"For the last two Wednesdays, the smells and sounds of a meal being prepared – and friendships forming – have filled the JRS building and wafted up to where I sit on the first floor. Alongside the fragrant smells of spices frying and the clang of pots and pans being moved round comes vibrant music and ringing laughter as new friends and old meet and spend time with one another. These are the smells and sounds of our new Community Kitchen. This week, I couldn’t resist going downstairs to see everyone – and of course, to have my portion of the meal – and there smiling faces and a full plate of Yam Porridge served with fried fish and plantain awaited me. After the meal, I sat down with Mark Dunn, Community Projects Coordinator, to learn more about how the Community Kitchen has come to life and how refugee friends have taken it forward. Community Kitchen is a space where refugee friends come together and use the kitchen at JRS to share recipes with each other, teach each other how to cook, and then eat together once the food is cooked. You may also have picked up that it’s all about being together! Each week, refugee friends will tell us what they want to make, what the ingredients they need are and whether they need us to buy the ingredients beforehand, or if they would prefer to go to a local market and get it themselves. On the day we’ll have about 10 to 12 other refugee friends in the kitchen. The refugee friend who’s leading the session will take complete ownership of the kitchen and show other refugee friends how to cook the meal. The friends involved will be helping with preparations, chopping the veg, cleaning and washing the meat and the fish, helping to cook, helping to clean up as we go along. I think, because of how practical it is, that helps people just to break down barriers, talk to each other, make new friends. It’s a very joyful space. Friends chopping veg together I actually don’t know where the recipes are coming from. Our refugee friends don’t write down their recipes. They just know it in their heads. They don’t need to weigh things. They just know intrinsically what needs to be done, how much spice is to be used for certain foods. Most of it, I think is very intuitive to people… which is completely different to how I cook! This week we made yam porridge and fish which was fried. And we also had fried plantain as well. And it was – of course – super, super tasty.  Yam porridge, fried fish and plantain People have said that it’s really helped with their mental health, that they feel a lot more relaxed coming together in the kitchen, that they aren’t stressed or thinking about the home office, or their accommodation issues, and that their mental health and their mood have really been lifted through coming together and doing the Community Kitchen. I think there’s something about the physicality of cooking together. Everyone having to chip in to do the washing, the prepping, the cooking, and something around food. Bringing people together is really joyful and really communal. There’s something about cooking that everyone regardless of their background, can really resonate with. Really, it comes to life when refugee friends come into the kitchen – they bring the party, they bring the life and soul to the organisation and it’s through their joy and love of cooking, of being together, dancing together while the music is on – that’s how the Community Kitchen comes together. Friends all chip in to cook the meal Some people are stuck in hotels – so in asylum accommodation – and have been there for months, and really are having a bad time with the food that is precooked for them, that is not suitable for their dietary needs, their cultural needs. There are also some people who are sofa surfing, who don’t have access to a kitchen or their friends don’t allow them to have access to the kitchen. They might be dependent on other people to cook for them or on charities to get food. So knowing that they can come here and cook something themselves and have the agency to cook for themselves in a really joyful space with others is great.  The kitchen at JRS When people walk into the kitchen that their faces light up, knowing that they’re in control of what they’re cooking and that they’re doing that themselves.  It gives our friends agency back and utilises their skills. I think that’s the classic thing with the Home Office and the Hostile Environment – as a deterrent, they do try to strip people of agency to deskill people and to make people feel like their life isn’t worth living. So where possible, we can try to give agency back to refugee friends, to give them a space to use their skills and their talents. It’s really empowering for people, and you can just see the joy when people can do that. With our activities programme in general, it almost doesn’t matter what you are doing but the fact of bringing people together over an activity and connecting is essential. It holds a really important space to resisting the hostile environment for people on an individual level so that they can survive – joy as a resistance in and of itself is really important. Seeing how connected people become at the end of Community Kitchen, is really, really special.  At the end of a morning of cooking, everyone sits down to eat together Next week we will be having some Ethiopian food, Injera, which is very exciting and maybe we will have some Ethiopian coffee going! The Community Kitchen will run for eight weeks at a time. Follow along with the other food we make on our social media, or keep your eyes peeled for more updates! [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,It’s been a joy to wake up knowing: I’m going to JRS today!,26-Jan-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/its-been-a-joy-to-wake-up-knowing-im-going-to-jrs-today/,"As a seminarian on my first year at the Royal English College of St Alban, in Valladolid, Spain, I was given the great opportunity of a 3-week placement volunteering at JRS in Wapping. It has been a blessed opportunity to experience social justice in action. Over the years I have read countless articles about refugees, but there is a vast difference between reading and then actually meeting those who are real refugees, people who are struggling against incredible obstacles to reach a safe and stable position in life. When refugees come through the door, they are part of the family, made to feel at home. I learnt that they are called ‘friends’, and that’s how it feels. Helping in the shop where refugee friends can come and collect food, clothes and toiletries, has been one of my favourite responsibilities during my time at JRS, due to the interaction with everyone. It’s a welcoming space, an opportunity for encounter, and sitting down with a warm drink, being able to talk and laugh has been wonderful. Also, the activities that take place at JRS are a great way to get to know everyone and also experience their culture, through cooking (which was superb) and art. Apart from my growth in understanding of the refugee situation in the UK, for me, there is another level to this work. I genuinely feel that my time at JRS has put the words of Christ into practice and allowed me to grow. Matthew 25:40 says “Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.” and through the work of JRS, I have seen the face of Christ in all those who came through the door. Volunteering at JRS has been an enriching and very enjoyable experience. The team are very friendly, and they help to make JRS feel warm and welcoming. I have found it a joy to wake up knowing I’m going to be going into JRS for the day. Ashley [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"In the face of growing hostility and adversity, where do we find our hope of the New Year? We find it in solidarity.",12-Jan-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/in-the-face-of-growing-hostility-and-adversity-where-do-we-find-our-hope-of-the-new-year-we-find-it-in-solidarity/,"As we begin the New Year, we take the time to take stock of the year just gone – to celebrate the victories and accomplishments, big or small, and reflect on the difficulties and challenges that may provide an opportunity to learn and grow. We also take the chance to press the reset button, wipe the slate clean and look afresh at what may be possible in the year ahead. Sadly, as I look back over the last year and what it indicates the coming year may hold, I feel there may be a lot of challenging times ahead for our refugee friends and for those coming to the UK to seek safety. Just as the year came to a close,the High Court ruled that the government’s plan to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their claims processed was lawful, despite finding that the Home Secretary had not properly considered the circumstances for each of the eight individuals involved in this case. We now await upcoming decisions on how the appeals process will unfold and we could be in for a long wait until a final decision is reached on the lawfulness of the Rwanda policy. Exactly how this policy is implanted is yet to be seen but from my experience of supporting men threatened with relocation to Rwanda last June when the policy was first introduced, we can be certain thatit will cause an immense amount of stress, uncertainty and suffering for those seeking safety in the UK. Additionally, asthe government announces further “new plans for asylum”, and more of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 starts to come in to effect, the hostility directed by the government towards those seeking refuge is deepening. We are starting to see the act of seeking asylum further criminalised, as entering the UK to claim asylum without prior permission is made a criminal offence. “Illegal entry” now also affects the protection and rights you may be granted and couldprevent someone from ever settling in the UK; punishing those seeking asylum for something often completely outside of their control. Such developments are doubly painful when considering that onlyfour Afghan nationals have arrived in the UK via the Afghan Citizen’s Resettlement Scheme, one of the few “legal” resettlement routes, since the fall of Kabul and theHome Secretary couldn’t even give an example of how the vast majority of asylum seekers could travel “legally” to the UK. So against this backdrop, in the face of growing hostility and adversity, where do we find our hope of the New Year? We find it in solidarity. In solidarity with our refugee friends. Standing alongside them, offering support and comfort where we can in their fight against a hostile and oppressive system. In solidarity with other organisations. From grassroots to community groups, local initiatives to national organisations, there is a wealth of resource and drive to provide support to all those who find themselves on the margins of society. In solidarity with each other. Every person who gives, donates and supports JRS and all organisations working with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants stands against the division being sown by anti-refugee rhetoric. The year ahead looks tough but we hold on to this hope found in the solidarity of others. William is Detention Outreach Caseworker at JRS UK.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"Irrespective of the High Court Judgment, sending asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing is deeply immoral",19-Dec-22,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/irrespective-of-the-high-court-judgment-sending-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-for-processing-is-deeply-immoral/,"The government’splansto send asylum seekers, forcibly and permanently, to Rwanda are cruel and dangerous. They are creating fear and trauma for people to whom we owe care. They show no respect for human dignity, human safety, or even human life. They have no good purpose. The High Courtrulingtoday, that the policy is legal, does nothing to change this. Whether or not it is legal, it is profoundly immoral. This is not how any decent society treats human beings who arrive at its door, often traumatised and afraid, asking for sanctuary. If this is the law, the law needs to change. Forcibly transferring people seeking sanctuary on our shores to another country, without even examining their claim, is grotesque, violent, and inhuman. To outsource asylum is to abandon our responsibility to provide sanctuary to refugees. The policy is unworkable, as I havewritten before. Cruelty here costs much more than compassion, in that removing thousands of unwilling people a year to another continent is extraordinarily difficult and astronomically expensive. It also won’t solve any of the existing problems in our asylum system. By creating more hurdles within the asylum process, it will lengthen it further, and increase the backlog of cases. Furthermore, judged against the government’s stated aims of reducing dangerous journeys and tackling people smugglers, the Rwanda policy is counterproductive. This is acknowledged by an alarming range of people with knowledge of the issue: the Home Office official tasked with facilitating it refused to sign off on the policy on the basis that there wasinsufficient evidenceit would work as a deterrent; and The United Nations Humanitarian Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] haswarnedthat the plan is likely to forcemorepeople to take dangerous journeys. As the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby recentlystated“It is not a solution. It is a mistake, and it will be a failure.” This policy, then, is neither a rational, nor even a serious, response to small boat crossings. What it does achieve is to perform cruelty towards refugees and in the process to scapegoat them. And the policy is so obviously unworkable, on any other level, that this is presumably its true purpose, what its architects wanted it to achieve. In their unflinching, irrational commitment to the Rwanda scheme, the government theatrically demonstrates that they will stop at nothing to force refugees to leave our shores, on any terms, irrespective of the human cost. At the heart of this demonstration is the dehumanisation and demonisation of refugees. It is at the heart of a wider scheme to punish refugees for how they travel, and part and parcel of a political narrative that casts refugees as ‘invaders’ and treats them with inhumanity. On one level, we are asked to believe that refugees are such a big problem as to necessitate extreme measures, to believe that these measures are acceptable because refugees do not matter, and to the overlook the fact that the measures do not offer any kind of solution. On another, even darker, level, we are asked to rejoice at the prospect of such cruelty and suffering – to share in the Home Secretary’sdreamsof sending refugees to Rwanda. This politics is diseased, callous, wrong. It is profoundly damaging to us as a society. As Welby says, “When we fail to challenge the harmful rhetoric that refugees are the cause of this country’s ills—that they should be treated as problems and not people, invaders to be tackled and deterred—we deny the essential value and dignity of fellow human beings.” We will not fail to do so. This politics hasn’t sprung to life suddenly in a vacuum. It has grown out of two decades in which the immigration detention estate and hostile environment were established and nurtured. Our politics shouldn’t be in this space. Amid the many reactions to the high court’s judgement, we must remember: this policy should not be merely illegal, it should be unthinkable.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS Writing and Drama Group prepares for Advent Service performance,13-Dec-22,https://www.jrsuk.net/blog/jrs-writing-and-drama-group-at-advent-service/,"For the past few months, Poetry Coordinator, Laila Sumpton and Drama Coordinator, Beth Organ have been facilitating creative workshops for refugee friends at JRS. The JRS Writing and Drama Group’s creative work has been developed into a performance to be taking place at the JRS Advent Service next week. We have asked Laila and Beth to share with us what the group has been working on.  Can you first tell us a bit about this community activity group for refugee friends and your roles in it? Laila:The JRS Writing and Drama Group brings together friends to explore their creative expression and share stories. It is a wonderfully supportive space, where we all (facilitators included) learn and grow together. In our two-hour sessions there were deep conversations about the asylum-seeking process, discussions about language and performance and lots of laughter. Beth:I design and deliver the drama workshops here at JRS. The workshops usually consist of games and exercises that encourage our friends to explore storytelling, character and creativity, and have enormous fun doing it! The most effective drama tool I use in our workshops is what we call ‘improvisation’ or ‘improv’, and in the context of our sessions this means working together as a team to build a shared imaginary situation. It also means a chance to have fun and be a bit silly, which is always a massive benefit of working in drama!  How was the creative writing process developed? Leila:The Friends were supported to develop a character who was waiting in anticipation for something—and in order to find this person they had to understand their personality, present worries and joys. After lots of work filling in the details of their character’s lives, friends were given some different ways to begin and structure their dramatic monologue—when one character tells the audience the inner workings of their mind and the issues they are navigating. We performed everything that was written, and the group were really supportive of each other—asking for more details about each other’s characters, giving encouragement and suggestions. It was fantastic to see the characters grow in depth and clarity and I am so excited to see the performance!  What has the journey from writing to staging the performance been like? Beth:I’ve been delighted, moved and inspired by the work that has been created in the writing sessions; they’ve really given us a fantastic foundation to build our performance from. Over the last few weeks, we’ve been working on bringing these poems into a dramatised situation. Asking ourselves where the characters are, why they are speaking, what do they want to achieve? Then we’ve started to bring them into the space and physically develop the performance of the pieces, collaboratively, inspired in particular by the structures of Greek Theatre and Chorus.  ‘I’m excited by everything we do in the workshops; writing poems, meeting people. I’m looking forward about being in the performance,’ shares a refugee friend participating in the community activity group.  What are your joys running this creative writing and drama group? Laila:Seeing the collaboration, confidence and solidarity between friends grow and watching their characters come alive! Beth:It is always a joy running the JRS drama group. I’m continuously overjoyed to experience the group using their voices and imaginations, unlocking their creativity and self-expression, making art in fearless ways. I love setting up a game or an exercise and watching our group run with it, adding their own personality and flare. Trying drama for the first time can be quite intimidating and feels a little bit exposing, but everyone in our drama group engages with the workshops with bravery and humour. It’s a joy to be a part of!  Can you share with our readers what refugee friends’ performance will look like at the Advent Service? Beth:This will be a poetry reading unlike any other. We’re combining our friends’ written word with their spoken voice, sung voice, physical movement and rhythm. We asked ourselves: how can we tell these stories together? Everything you will see in the performance has come intuitively from our friends’ written words. It was all there on the page for us to draw from and make three-dimensional. We hope you’ll be moved, inspired and uplifted by the performance.  A refugee friend shares with us what the activity group means to them: ‘I feel more confident. Through the workshops I know there are others in a similar situation as me. We have shared experiences with each other. I feel less depressed than before.’  What are you most excited for the JRS community to see at refugee friends’ Advent Service performance? Laila:Audiences will have a special window into the worlds of some beautifully crafted characters who are trying to remain hopeful as they wait for change and try their best to make that change happen. Beth:I am most excited for the JRS community to see and hear a performance that comes straight from the hearts of our refugee friends. I’ve been so impressed with the amazing characters our friends have created in the drama group this term, whose lives we will see a snapshot of during the performance. Every word spoken was written by our friends, and paints a picture of their characters’ hopes, worries, and ambitions. We are transported from a call to action in a desert to a whispered wish in a park, from a letter landing gently on the doormat to a silent phone that is being begged to ring. For a moment are shown a window into five lives, thanks to the bravery, imagination and creativity of our refugee friends. [Back to the blog]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK calls for Bibby Stockholm to be closed following reported suicide,12-Dec-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-uk-calls-for-bibby-stockholm-to-be-closed-following-reported-suicide/,"The Jesuit Refugee Service UK (JRS UK) has repeated calls for the government to close theBibby Stockholmbarge after a person died there on Tuesday in a reported suicide. Sarah Teather, Director of JRS UK said: “These are the real human consequences of deliberate and performative cruelty against people seeking sanctuary in the UK. It is time to stop focusing on the politics and start considering the people whose lives are torn apart by these appalling practices. The government must immediately stop placing people on theBibby Stockholm, and instead ensure they can access safe and dignified accommodation in our communities.” Forcing people to live on the barge is part of a wider move to place those seeking asylum in large-scale, institutional, out-of-town, and quasi-detention settings, that is strongly opposed by JRS UK. Earlier this year the charity warned that: “Those forced to live on the barge will be subjected to overcrowding and, at best, face severe restrictions in movement. Large-scale, detention-like sites such as this expose people who have fled danger to severe re-trauma; cause near universal, chronic sleep deprivation; and rapidly lead to deterioration in their mental health.” Following the death on Tuesday, Sarah Teather added: “We know only too well from our experience of accompanying people at Napier Barracks, the brutal reality of these large-scale containment sites. They are deeply harmful. Our thoughts and prayers are with the man who died, his friends and family, those still onboard the barge, and everyone affected by this tragedy.” More information: JRS UKBibby Stockholminformation sheet:jrsuk.net/bibby-stockholm-barge/ JRS UKNapier Barracks: the inhumane realityjrsuk.net/napier-report/ [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK welcomes Supreme Court Ruling on Rwanda,15-Nov-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-uk-welcomes-supreme-court-ruling-on-rwanda/,"The Jesuit Refugee Service UK (JRS UK) has welcomed today’s Supreme Court decision against government plans to transfer people seeking asylum to Rwanda, and called for the proposal to be permanently scrapped. Sarah Teather, Director of JRS UK, responded to the judgement: “JRS UK has consistently opposed this cruel and unworkable policy. We now call for the government to abandon it. Forcibly removing people to Rwanda would achieve nothing except to violate their basic rights, trash the UK’s reputation on the international stage, and exacerbate fear and uncertainty among those seeking sanctuary here.” JRS UK has directly supported more than twenty people, including survivors of torture, facing removal to Rwanda. The threat of removal is felt far more widely. Through our accompaniment of refugees,we understand the human impact of this policyand the profound dangers it presents to people in search of safety. Emphasising the continued challenges facing refugees in the UK Sarah Teather added: “While this policy has been ruled unlawful, the profound trauma it caused remains, alongside a raft of other hostile policies devastating the lives of refugee friends we accompany. We will continue to advocate for a fairer asylum system that recognises our responsibility to offer sanctuary and builds upon the welcome extended by so many people and communities throughout the UK. We urge people to get involved and help us to advocate for a more compassionate system.” JRS UK will continue to accompany, serve, and advocate with and for refugees and people held in immigration detention. We cannot do this without your support. Thank you for any donations you’re able to make to help us to keep fighting for a fair and humane asylum system. Donate today [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Write a Christmas Card for people held in immigration detention,14-Nov-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/write-a-christmas-card-for-people-held-in-immigration-detention/,"Dear friends, As the days start to draw shorter and the weather takes a colder turn, our minds begin to look ahead to Christmas and all the preparations that come with it. For many of us, Christmas is a time spent celebrating with family and friends – surrounding ourselves with our nearest and dearest to share food, gifts and general seasonal joy. For those accompanied by JRS UK, however, Christmas and New Year – as with any large celebration throughout the year – can be a much more difficult time as it is often a reminder of the people and communities that they are separated from. Feelings of isolation and loneliness that many experience may increase over this time, especially our friends who will continue to be indefinitely detained over Christmas and New Year. The ever-increasing hostile approach taken by our government to those seeking safety in our country creates a sense of disconnection between our friends at JRS UK and wider community to the extent that individuals may feel pushed to the fringes of society. Our friends who are detained are very deliberately cut off from wider society having been incarcerated in removal centres that are often far away from the communities they were taken from. Those we support in detention find a great deal of support from our volunteer social visitors as a way of reconnecting with the world outside of detention. We would therefore like to invite you to take part in this year’s Christmas Card Appeal and help us to send a Christmas card and message of solidarity and support to all those supported by JRS. We hope that these messages might bring small bit of comfort, connection and encouragement at this time. Thank you for all your prayers and support this year. All the best,Will Here are our Top Tips: Cards should be sent to the JRS UK offices and we will distribute them in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Please leave your Christmas card envelopes unsealed and place them in a second sealed envelope to post them to JRS UK.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK Opens Amani House for Male Refugee Friends,13-Oct-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-uk-opens-amani-house-for-male-refugee-friends/,"Many years ago, the Sisters of the Holy Family of St Emilie and the Jesuits in Britain piloted the JRS At Home hosting scheme. Today, thanks to their ongoing commitment to our work, those who first opened their doors to our refugee friends have now made two housing projects possible. Donate items to help make our new men’s house a home We know that safe and stable accommodation is, increasingly, one of the most pressing challenges of a complexly hostile environment. This is why over the past 10 years, JRS UK has been working alongside our supporters to develop and expand our Accommodation Project; growing our hosting community, and more recently, opening houses for our refugee friends to live independently. Many of our refugee friends require a longer-term and more stable accommodation option than hosting – particularly if they have health needs, are receiving trauma counselling or need to engage intensively with their legal case. Thanks to the kindness of the Sisters of the Holy Family of St Emilie, in 2021 we were delighted to be able to open a house to female refugee friends – Emilie House. This transformative new provision has offered our refugee friends a unique opportunity to regain independence and vital life-skills. Emilie House gives people the chance to belong to a growing community of residents, staff, and volunteers. Our refugee friends have been able to settle into a home that feels equally their own, for a long-term placement, until other accommodation options become available to them. When Emilie House was officially opened, one of the first residents shared that she:“hope(s) that JRS can get other more houses to help more people in the future”. The good news is that this has become a reality! Emilie House will now be a model for Amani House, our new home for male refugee friends. The Jesuits in Britain have made this property available to us and many other generous Catholic partners have made financial contributions to support the sustainability of the project or cover the running costs. Amani(Am – ah – nee)translates to hope/wishes in Arabic, and peace in Swahili. Preparations are currently underway to open Amani House this winter to our male refugee friends. The impact of providing long term accommodation at Emilie House can be seen in Sara’s story. Sara is a natural carer and extrovert. She is at her happiest when sharing conversation and food with other people. It doesn’t matter where someone is from or if they don’t speak the same language, she always makes them feel welcome. When Sara* was referred to JRS her confidence was diminished and she was in a very difficult situation. The trauma she has experienced both in her home country and in the UK has affected her mental and physical health and she struggles with this. Sara still has many battles ahead, but she now has a home. She speaks to the other residents, staff and volunteers and this distracts her from her struggles. She is often also supporting other residents, checking they are taking care of themselves and telling jokes to lift their mood. She has brought so much laughter to the house. Sara joins in with activities at the house, like sewing and gardening, and can now host her friends again – cooking, sharing food and relaxing in the company of others. She has started weekly volunteering doing something she is passionate about, and her mood seems lifted each time we see her return from a session and hear her stories from the day. Having somewhere stable to live independently has had a huge impact on Sara’s confidence and general health. The support of the wider JRS team enables her to keep focussed on her asylum case even when it is difficult, and she is no longer afraid that she is going to be made homeless again at any moment. “The house changed a lot of my life, because before I come in, I couldn’t sleep all night. I’m scared at night. I doing a lot of thinking what will happen to me, but now I can support people. I get the people support me, anytime I talk to them. They give me a support, moral support, and I’m more better now.” Sara’s real name has been replaced to protect her identity. We are incredibly grateful for the kindness of our dedicated supporters for making such important services available to our refugee friends. We look forward to keeping you up to date as the men’s house becomes a home. Donate items to Amani House [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS responds to the reports of the contents of the Home Secretary’s speech to the American Enterprise Institute later today,26-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-responds-to-the-reports-of-the-contents-of-the-home-secretarys-speech-to-the-american-enterprise-institute-later-today/,"The Home Secretary is due to speak to the American Enterprise Institute today and has trailed in advance that she intends to make a wide-ranging attack on the principles on which the UN Refugee Convention was built. Sarah Teather, JRS UK Director, said in response to reports of the contents of the Home Secretary’s speech: “The Refugee Convention is a vital and core mechanism to protect people fleeing persecution, and it is badly needed, now as much and more than ever. To suggest that many of those to whom it has extended protection for decades should be shut out and cast back into danger is appalling. The government should work to extend protection to those who need it, not to find new ways to deny sanctuary. These comments from the Home Secretary are the latest in a cruel, vaunting attack on refugees. “Indeed, one is left to wonder who the Home Secretary is trying to court with this international speech? Is her focus political and aimed at her own party? If so, she is recklessly giving comfort to dictators and tyrannical regimes on the world stage for vain purpose. Her attack on LGBTQI+ community is particularly concerning given the scale of oppression worldwide. “In his message for the World Day of Migrants and Refugees, which we marked at the weekend, Pope Francis renewed his call for the practice of ‘good politics – one that is transparent, honest, farsighted and at the service of all, especially those most vulnerable’; these actions from the Home Secretary today are anything but. “Where people are forcibly displaced from their homes, we have a human duty to work together to seek solutions. Trying to draw others into a coordinated attack on those in need is a new low.” [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) UK renews calls for an end immigration detention in wake of report on abuse in Brook House IRC,19-Sep-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/the-jesuit-refugee-service-jrs-uk-renews-calls-for-an-end-immigration-detention-in-wake-of-report-on-abuse-in-brook-house-irc/,"JRS UK has again called for an end to the use of detention for immigration control following the publication of areportdetailing abuse of people detained at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre (IRC). The report is the outcome of an independentinquiryinto abuse by staff of people detained at Brook House IRC between April and August 2017. The abuse first came to light when an employee at Brook House was so horrified by what he witnessed that he worked with BBC Panorama to make adocumentaryexposing it, “Under Cover: Britain’s Immigration Secrets”. The report, published today, draws on testimony of people detained at Brook House and finds numerous instances of violent abuse against detained people including dangerous uses of force and force used to “provoke and punish”. It identifies 19 incidents of treatment amounting to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment including – that is, treatment in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) – and notes that it is especially concerning there were so many incidents within such a short timeframe. The report calls for systemic changes in the way immigration detention operates, including a 28-day time limit on immigration detention, which is currently indefinite. The report is published just as sweeping new powers to detain people, and maintain their detention, arbitrarily areabout to come into forceunder the Illegal Migration Act; and relatedly against the background of the aggressive expansion of the detention estate. Sarah Teather, JRS UK’s Director, said:“This report is further, painful proof of just how destructive immigration detention is. The horrifying events in Brook House are not isolated. They are part and parcel of a wider system. Detention routinely dehumanises people and denies them justice. It causes lasting damage to those subjected to it. If we are serious about this never happening again, the use of detention for immigration control must end. Instead, the government is aggressively expanding it and even planning to subject children to routine and indefinite detention. Sweeping new powers allowing the government to detain people arbitrarily are about to come into force. This is outrageous, and the inquiry report again shows why. It is not too late to take a different course.” The publication of the report follows the death of Frank Ospina in Colnbrook IRC, and amass suicide attemptby a group of men held at Harmondsworth IRC, both in March of this year. It sits in the context of a wide body of research and testimony pointing to the lasting trauma caused by immigration detention, includingresearchby JRS UK.Introducing the reportinto Brook House, the inquiry chair expressed concern about a lack of progress towards cultural change. Naomi Blackwell, JRS UK’s Detention Outreach Manager, said:“The evidence of the men subjected to horrific abuse at Brook House shines a light on the deep harm caused by immigration detention. Supporting people held in detention, we see time and again the huge impact on their mental health, and the way that normal human relationships are broken by detention.” The inquiry was set up on 4thNovember 2019, and grew out of a special investigation of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,People have now been moved onto the Bibby Stockholm,07-Aug-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/people-have-now-been-moved-onto-the-bibby-stockholm/,"JRS UK are outraged to learn that people seeking asylum have now been moved onto the Bibby Stockholm barge. As it will now operate, the barge is quasi-detention. It is wholly inappropriate as accommodation for those seeking sanctuary. It represents a move to cut those seeking asylum off from our communities, and to dehumanise them. Those forced to live on the barge willbe subjected to overcrowding and, at best, face severe restrictions in movement.Large-scale, detention-like sites like this expose people who have fled danger to severe re-trauma; cause near universal, chronic sleep deprivation; and rapidly lead to deterioration in the mental health. At JRS UK, we know this only too well from our experience of accompanying people placed atNapier barracks. It is horrifying to see the government not only doubling-down on its plan to roll-out quasi-detention, but even finding new ways to expand this plan and deepen its inhumanity. Furthermore, people have been moved to the barge despiteserious concernsabout fire safety and the risk of the outbreak of disease in such close quarters, showing disregard not only for their dignity and wellbeing, but even for their lives. We call for those placed on the barge to be urgently provided with safe alternative accommodation in British communities; for plans to use the Bibby Stockholm as asylum accommodation to be halted; and for the government to abandon all plans to accommodate asylum seekers on barges and in other quasi-detention settings.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Illegal Migration Bill becomes UK Law,18-Jul-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/illegal-migration-bill-becomes-uk-law/,"The passing of the so-called Illegal Migration Bill by parliament is outrageous. This Bill represents a ban on claiming asylum. It contravenes the Refugee Convention and is wantonly cruel. It will mean men, women, and children are incarcerated on a massive scale. It will leave hundreds and thousands in limbo for years on end. It will strip modern slavery survivors of protections and empower traffickers. And it has been forced through parliament at breakneck speed, avoiding scrutiny wherever possible. This Bill is anti-refugee, it is anti-human. At its passage, we are angry, and we are sorrowful. And we have not given up. We will continue to stand in solidarity with refugees as our government attacks them. The Illegal Migration Bill must be overturned. Sarah Teather, JRS UK’s Director, said:“The Illegal Migration Bill drags any sense of the UK’s moral leadership on the world stage headlong into a gutter of hate. In it, we have abandoned the principle of refugee protection, and denied that we have a duty to anyone else in the world. We haven’t even done this to achieve any useful end, but revelled in sheer performative cruelty. “I am particularly horrified that Parliament has decided to revert to wholesale incarceration of children in the immigration system, a practice I was instrumental in outlawing when in Government. “At JRS UK, we shall continue to oppose this despicable piece of legislation and call on politicians from all parties to overturn it at the earliest opportunity.” [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Rwanda Scheme found to be UNLAWFUL!,29-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/rwanda-scheme-found-to-be-unlawful/,"Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that transferring asylum seekers to Rwanda isnot legal. It’s high time the goverment ends all plans to forcibly transfer people seeking asylum to Rwanda Sarah Teather, JRS UK’s Director, said: “Plans to forcibly send men, women and children seeking sanctuary here to Rwanda are inhuman. They are also completely impractical. They are destructive, and mean slamming the door shut on refugees, denying our duty to offer refugees sanctuary. We welcome this judgement as we continue to resist this cruel policy in solidarity with refugees.“ In April 2022, the government announced plans to forcibly and permanently send some people who seek asylum in the UK toRwanda, under aMigration and Economic Development Partnershipbetween the UK and Rwandan governments. As part of the plan, the Rwandan government will then have responsibility for their asylum claims. It will process their claims and, crucially,if they are recognised as refugees, they will stay in Rwanda. A flight was scheduled to take people to Rwanda on 14thJune 2022. Several attempts to stop it in UK courts had failed, but the European Court of Human Rights stopped the flightnoton the basis that the scheme was illegal, but on the basis that ongoing cases in the UK courts must be played outbeforethe flight could take place, as the outcome of these cases may have implications for the legality of the flight. On 19thDecember 2022,the High Court issued its rulingin one key case, and declared that the scheme was legal, but it did, in January, grant a right of appeal on key aspects of the case. Today, on a majority decision, the Court of appeal reversed the High Court’s judgement, ruling that the Rwanda scheme was illegal, on the basis that it did not ensure that asylum claims would be fairly processed, and therefore also did not ensure that people would be protected from removal into danger. The scheme has been verywidely criticisedas carrying a high risk of human rights abuses, abrogating the UK’s responsibilities to refugees, and being both costly and ineffective. Government analysis published last weekestimatedthe scheme would cost £169,000 per refugee, on top of the £120 million already paid to Rwanda. Though the government estimated cost-savings from not accommodating people in the UK, their estimates here appear to behugely optimistic, and assume that refugees would be in asylum accommodation indefinitely, rather than having their claims processed promptly and entering the workforce. Furthermore, though the scheme is ostensibly intended to act as a deterrent to irregular entry to the UK, the government’s analysis admits “The academic consensus is that there is little to no evidence suggesting changes in a destination country’s policies have an impact on deterring people from leaving their countries of origin or travelling without valid permission, whether in search of refuge or for other reasons.” The Illegal Migration Bill currently before parliament would render the majority of asylum claims inadmissible and place a duty on the Home Secretary to remove those whose claims are inadmissible. The government has stated that the Memorandum of Understanding with Rwanda is part of what will enable them to do this, butexpertsare dubious about the possibility of deploying the scheme at scale. The court judgement further exposes the government’s plans as based on a fiction. [All News]Share: [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,"“My thoughts are my secret power”: You can see me, but I don’t exist",27-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/my-thoughts-are-my-secret-power-you-can-see-me-but-i-dont-exist/,"The launch of the collaborative project“You can see me but I don’t exist”between refugees and asylum seekers in the UK and photographer Alan Gignoux took place across the UK over the past few weeks; with the London launches timed for Refugee Week. The project was initially inspired by an encounter between Alan and a young man in Sweden, who shared with Alan “I feel like I’ve been in Limbo. I feel like you can see me but I don’t really exist – I wasn’t allowed to work, I just had to wait.” This experience is not unique, and is shared with thousands of people across Europe. Alan partnerered with JRS UK on a camera obscura photography project, visualising the feeling of being seen but not exisiting. The project grew to include poetry alongside photography, and partners included Stories of Hope and Home and Baobab Women’s Project in Birmingham, and Everything Human Rights in Manchester. The launch events are a huge celebration of colleaborative work over the past two years, with JRS being involved in Stratford Library and the Photographer’s gallery. Victoria and Dallya share a rundown of the highlights of the two events, and how refugee friends felt on the night. The Launch event at Stratford Library was an excellent start to JRS’ Refugee Week celebrations. Refugee friends spent the afternoon rehearsing for their first public performanace of the poetry, and one performer described: “I have stage fright…but tonight I’m going to challenge that”. Eight refugee friends performed poetry that evening, surrounded by the photography exhibited on the walls of the Library. After Alan introduced the project and the inspiration behind it,Laila Sumpton, poet and long term collaborator with JRS, shared a little about the experience of the writing project which crafted poems in response to the photographs; poems which set out to share the power of words, share the refugee lived experience, and dispel myths about asylum. One by one, refugee friends stood up and performed their poems. Before speaking, each refugee friend introduced what inspired their poem. Some were written individually, others were collaborative pieces reflecting the experiences of many. Some refugee friends performed their own poems, others the poems of refugee friends who could not attend the event. Refugee friends’ voices and the breadth of their experiences really shone through the poems – some were funny, others were sad and reflective, others determined and hopeful. The audience listened, captivated by these readings, whilst the words and photographs of so many other asylum seekers awaiting recognition hung on the walls around us. The poem you are about to hear is about a stagnant situation, where you’re in a dilemma. When you’re at a crossroads. Where will I turn to? Is it right? Is it left? Front? Or Back? This is a place where refugees and migrants find themselves: Limbo.   The final poem was performed collectively by the group, bringing to life the sounds and voices of a street market. Everyone in the audience was made a part of the performance, enthusiastically taking part in the grocer’s cry of“a pound a bowl”at the close of every stanza. With that, the event came to a close, with time for visitors to wander around the exhibition and look at the poems and photographs side by side. Before leaving the event, the refugee friend who had stage fright a the beginning shared:“I thought it went well – I stuttered a little bit…But next time? Next time I’ll be even better”. Home is a feeling not a place The first published work of JRS UK’sOpen WritingSpace, facilitated by Laila Sumpton, features poetry and prose written by eight refugee friends. The volume explores themes including lockdown, the meaning of ‘home’, the climate emergency, and peace and is available to buy from the JRS Refugee Gifts Shop. All proceeds go to support the work of JRS UK. Explore JRS Refugee Gifts Shop The experience of the first performance clearly emboldened the confidence of refugee friends for the Friday evening celebration at the Photographer’s Gallery in Central London. This was a “Book Launch in an Exhibition”, and a light, festive feel permeated the group, who were accompanied by others from Birmingham and Manchester. Once again, the poetry was raw and powerful, but also shot through with hope and determination. It was a warm, sunny evening and the large windows were opened onto the street, as passers-by stopped to listen, consecutive groups gathered throughout the performances. A particular injection of joy came from a Zimbabwean band who played their home-made marimba, sang and danced with bells on their feet and delighted the entire company – including the passers-by who felt drawn in! Dallya, JRS Refugees Activities Coordinator, congratulated refugee friends on their remarkable poems. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to show the world your voice. No one can take your voice away from you, so keep writing, keep singing and keep showing everyone how great you are. Events like these are remarkable – but should be commonplace! It was a wonderful demonstration of the creativity, intelligence and resilience of people we accompany, and of the power of collaboration. There was a real feeling of awe in the room as the final line of one of the poems was read: “our secret power is our thoughts”. This rung true, and I hope inspires us all to keep working towards a world where refugee friends’ voices and thoughts are not secret but are at the centre of how the UK responds to those seeking sanctuary.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK renews calls for government to abandon Illegal Migration Bill as JCHR report finds the Bill would “deny the vast majority of refugees access to the UK’s asylum system”,13-Jun-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-uk-renews-calls-for-government-to-abandon-illegal-migration-bill-as-jchr-report-finds-the-bill-would-deny-the-vast-majority-of-refugees-access-to-the-uks-asylum-system/,"The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) UK has again renewed itscallsfor the government to abandon the “Illegal Migration Bill” in the wake of a new report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) stating that the Bill would “deny the vast majority of refugees access to the UK’s asylum system” and “breaches the object and purpose of the Refugee Convention”. JRS UK highlighted to the JCHR inwritten evidencethat the Bill would ban most refugees from claiming asylum in the UK; hugely expand the use of immigration detention and further reduce its oversight, creating a serious risk of widespread, arbitrary detention; strip modern slavery survivors of protection; and create a fresh risk of long-term destitution for refugees in the UK. Sarah Teather, JRS UK’s Director, said:“The JCHR’s findings are the latest in an overwhelming catalogue of evidence of the Illegal Migration Bill’s callous cruelty. This Bill would create a refugee ban. It would wreak vast human suffering, and it would serve no good purpose. The Bill must be abandoned in its entirety.” The JCHR is a cross-party parliamentary committee and an authoritative voice on Human Rights. Theirreport, “Legislative Scrutiny: Illegal Migration Bill” was published on Sunday by the Joint Committee for Human Rights (JCHR). The JCHR critiques the Bill on multiple other related levels, including expressing extreme concerns about “the expansion of powers of immigration detention under the Bill, and the apparent intention to use detention as a matter of course”. The JCHR recommends, among other things, removal from the Bill of respective clauses that would render most asylum claims inadmissible to the UK asylum system, and place the secretary of state under a duty to remove those deemed inadmissible. These clauses are at the heart of the Bill. The Illegal Migration Bill is currently undergoing Committee Stage in the House of Lords, where it may be amended, and will then return to the House of Commons. It is typical for the JCHR’s legislative scrutiny of a Bill to be published at an earlier stage of its progress through parliament, but the Illegal Migration Bill has been moved through parliament with exceptional speed, with ministers attractingcriticismfor avoiding necessary scrutiny.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Join JRS for Refugee Week 2023,23-May-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/join-jrs-for-refugee-week-2023/,"This year, the UK celebrates Refugee Week from Monday 19th to Sunday 25th June. During Refugee Week, charities and voluntary organisations coordinate on a week of arts, cultural and sports events across the UK which aims to celebrate the contributions and talents of refugees, raise awareness of the asylum system, what refugees in the UK face, and to break down barriers and foster connections across different backgrounds. JRS UK are excited to celebrate Refugee Week. In addition to an internal celebration day for our refugee friends, we’re taking part in several public events which you are warmly invited to join us for. In 2022, refugee friends from JRS UK worked with poet Laila Sumpton to write a collection of poetry for the ‘Limbo’ project. These poems, and others written by refugees living in Birmingham and Manchester, have been collected and will be displayed alongside an exhibition of photographs by Alan Gignoux. The exhibition will be on display atStratford Library, London fromMonday 19thJune to Saturday 1stJuly 2023. It speaks powerfully to the extended periods of uncertainty refugee friends face whilst waiting to hear on their asylum cases, and the hostility asylum seekers face. The refugee voice and experience is made central in the poetry, in stark contrast to the photography where faces are blurred and unclear, a visual representation of how our policies and asylum system dehumanises and marginalises people, and the erosion of self many people feel.

We will hear from people who have experience of living in the asylum camp at Napier Barracks and hear more about life in this setting and its effects upon people who have fled hostilities, abuses and life-threatening situations. This will undoubtedly be the most remarkable part of this event. This will be a chance for members of the local community, refugees, civic authorities, and other NGOs to meet together. The event is open to local residents and all those who care about the treatment of asylum seekers and the way they are impacted by our asylum system and current government policies. The event will also be streamed online for those who cannot physically attend.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,New Report – Napier Barracks: the inhumane reality,29-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/new-report-napier-barracks/,"JRS UK worked with people placed at Napier barracks in Kent for two years from when it was repurposed as asylum accommodation in autumn 2020. In September 2021, the government deployed emergency powers to extend the site’s use for this purpose for another five years. This move came despite significant criticism of facilities at the site, including a judgment from the High Court declaring them inadequate and the Home Office guilty of employing unlawful practices. Furthermore, the use of emergency powers circumvented consultation with local community that such an extension would normally require. Through the voices of those who have been placed there, this research explores life in this quasi-detention camp on a hill in Folkestone. It describes the effects upon people who have fled hostilities, abuses and life-threatening situations. It exemplifies how placing asylum seekers into remote camps is a punishing, confusing, often re-traumatising experience for those who endure it. The government plans to make sites like Napier the new normal for asylum accommodation, and this report demonstrates how profoundly destructive that would be for all those involved. This report is published as Illegal Migration Bill is before parliament. One of the many destructive things the Bill would do is to hugely expand the use of detention, and to allow for detention is spaces like Napier. If the Bill is made law, thousands of women, men, and children, barred from the asylum system that ought to protect them, will be pushed to the margins and behind closed doors, in spaces like Napier. This report gives insight into how destructive that would be. Read the report by Dr Sophie Cartwright [All News]"

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Love the Stranger,14-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/love-the-stranger/,"Love the Strangeris a powerful and timely reminder that refugees and migrants are our sister and brothers, made in God’s image, irrespective of how they arrive on our shores; that we all share a common humanity; and that this has deep and concrete implications for refugee and asylum policy and legislation. It is a Christian reflection on the humanity, dignity, and rights of refugees that speaks directly to our national context.Love the strangerrightly urges policymakers to protect and uphold the rights and dignity of refugees and migrants, to recognise refugees’ need to travel however they can, and to respect international law. In calling for these and other measures,Love the Strangermakes a call that is both profound and practical. It galvanises us to love and solidarity, and a time when so much political discourse – and indeed the law itself – is increasingly aimed at hatred and division. JRS UK accompanies and serves people who have sought asylum here, only to be denied sanctuary or justice, and subjected to prolonged destitution and detention. Time and again, we witness the human cost of an asylum system that does not respect human dignity. At a time when this dignity is threatened more than ever, we affirm and echo the Catholic Bishops’ call to avoid practices which violate human dignity, including immigration detention and arbitrary expulsion, to uphold the rights of refugees, and to celebrate their gifts and their humanity. Megan Knowles, JRS UK’s Interim Deputy Director said:“I’m delighted to commendLove the Stranger.Its powerful pages offer clear principles for a just and humane asylum system, rooted in encounter with, and respect for, individua human dignity. “The proposals stand in sharp contrast to the government’s vaunting attacks on refugee rights.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Illegal Migration Bill,06-Mar-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/illegal-migration-bill/,"Illegal Migration Bill The Nationality and Borders Act (2022) sought to criminalise arriving in the UK informally to seek asylum People that arrive without thiscould face four years in prison and removal to a safe country, althoughfewer than 100 people who arrived between 28 June and mid-November 2022 were arrested. The Act has been excoriated for contravening the Refugee Convention and attacking refugees, punishing them for circumstances far beyond their control. Now, the Government is expected to launch its most draconian anti-refugee legislation yet. It is anticipated that under the new laws, people arriving in small boats will: As with many pieces of recent legislation around immigration, these new measures purport to halt people traffickers who facilitate the channel crossings and appeal to voters who wish to see a curb on immigration. Instead of highlighting and tackling the enormous backlog in asylum claims, they divert attention to another “problem”, actually play into the hands of traffickers by making it impossible for their victims to seek help, and show no signs as yet of the necessary safe and legal routes. Sarah Teather, Director of the JRS UK said: “This proposed bill is the latest measure aiming to punish refugees for the realities of being forcibly displaced. Refugees travel however they can and there are vanishingly few formal routes for them. To deny sanctuary to people who need it based on their mode of arrival is grotesquely cruel and cravenly dishonest. Furthermore, these proposals are unworkable and are not a rational response to those seeking asylum on our shores. A more productive approach would be to create safe, accessible routes whilst embedding a culture of protection in our asylum system. As the former coalition Children and Families Minister I’m particularly appalled by the reported plans to begin wholesale detention of children. Once upon a time the Conservative Party recognised that this policy inflicted long term damage on young lives and vowed to stop the practice. If this commitment is abandoned now for headlines, it will mark a dark day indeed.” “Safe and Legal Routes” The Home Office claims that there are a number of “safe and legal” routes to the UK. However, these are only available to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine, or for British National status holders in Hong Kong. The numbers of refugees settled via these routes remain cripplingly small, only 22 people have so far been successfully resettled via the scheme created for vulnerable Afghans. Other asylum routes only accept a limited number of refugees according to precise criteria: For the vast majority of people who seek asylum in the UK there are no safe and legal routes. [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,Challenge this violence and hostility by community building,14-Feb-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/challenge-this-violence-and-hostility-by-community-building/,"JRS UK condemns the recent violent protests against refugees in Merseyside warning that left unchallenged, “hatred may breed further cycles of violence, hostility and community fracture.” Fifteen people were arrested after members of the far right led violent protests outside a hotel accommodating asylum seekers on 10th February. Protestors were armed with hammers and fireworks, threw stones and set fire to a police van, in full view of residents of the hotel who were trapped inside. “It is distressing to imagine the terrifying impact of this violence on those trapped in that hotel. People who have fled violence and war have already experienced significant trauma”said Sarah Teather, Director of JRS UK,“now they will carry this new trauma too, which is to our shame”. JRS UK have repeatedly expressed concern about the implications of inflammatory language and the impact of rising hostility in legislation and policy.“This episode of violence did not occur in a vacuum”, said Sarah Teather, JRS UK Director. “Rhetoric that seeks to divide society for short-term political gain has long-term and far-reaching consequences, hardening attitudes and emboldening racism. In the horrifying events in Merseyside over the weekend, we see its sour fruit.” JRS UK called for people from diverse communities across the UK to find ways to work together to build a sense of welcome and community for all.“Hatred and hostility tends to spread,“ Sarah said, “We cannot afford to let this kind of scapegoating seep deep into our communities where it may jump from one isolated group to another.” “There are many people in Merseyside working to provide safety to refugees and many others up and down the country who work to build bridges and understanding between people. These protests should be a wake-up call though. The freedom for us all to live alongside one another in peace, safety and security is not something we can take for granted: it is something we have to work at. Neither can we leave it for others to solve. We all play a role in the building of community. “It is time for people across sectors, faiths and politics to join together and play their part.” [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK renews calls for end to detention in wake of ICIBI report* calling out ineffectiveness of safeguards for vulnerable people detained people,12-Jan-23,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-uk-renews-calls-for-end-to-detention-in-wake-of-icibi-report-calling-out-ineffectiveness-of-safeguards-for-vulnerable-people-detained-people/,"JRS UK renews calls for end to detention in wake of ICIBI report* calling out ineffectiveness of safeguards for vulnerable detained people JRS UK has renewed its calls for an end to the use of detention under immigration powers in the wake of areportby theIndependent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration(ICIBI) finding that Rule 35, a key mechanism for identifying vulnerable people in detention, was “not working consistently or effectively”. The ICIBI report in question is the annual inspection of the ‘Adults at Risk in Immigration Detention’ [AAR]policy, and focused on Rule 35 reports. Rule 35 reports are a mechanism by which medical practitioners bring to the attention of Home Office staff cases where detained individuals’ health is likely to be harmed by detention; where there are concerns that detained individuals are suicidal; or where there are signs they are a survivor of torture. Rule 35 reports ought to trigger a review of detention, i.e., consideration of whether the person concerned should be released. Megan Knowles, JRS UK’s Deputy Director, said:“For decades, JRS UK has accompanied people subjected to immigration detention. We have witnessed, and continue to witness, the harm detention causes. This latest report is further proof that vulnerable people are not safeguarded in detention. For as long as detention exists, the Home Office must work to improve its safeguarding mechanisms. However, it is impossible to sufficiently safeguard people in the inhuman context of detention. The use of immigration detention must end.” Although this report is the latest of what has been an annual review of the adults at risk policy, the annual review process has just been scrapped by the government. The ICIBI, David Neal, and Stephen Shaw, author of the highly critical government-commissioned report on the welfare of vulnerable people in detention, have excoriated the government’s decision, which arises in the context of a growing use of detention and the temporary closure of Manston holding facility following conditions so horrendous they led to an outbreak of diphtheria. This occurs alongside other moves that reduce scrutiny of government decisions on immigration, including failure to appoint a new anti-slavery commissioner. Megan continued: “Already, decisions about detention happen behind high walls and locked doors. As this report shows, they need more scrutiny, not less. This scrapping of the annual AAR review is the latest a series of moves to sweep away oversight, from a government that refuses to listen to evidence and acts unilaterally, frequently illegally, and without concern for the high human cost.” JRS UK routinely supports survivors of torture, people suffering from suicidal ideation, and other vulnerable people in detention. Our detention outreach team routinely finds it a struggle to get these issues recognised, and finds that even where these vulnerabilities are recognised, people frequently remain in detention. In his foreword to the report, the ICIBI was also sceptical of widespread Home Office claims that detained people are “abusing” the Rule 35 system, saying they were insufficiently evidenced. In JRS UK’s experience, many people in detention are unaware of the systems at play there. The AAR policy was established following Stephen Shaw’s report.  *Third annual inspection of ‘Adults at risk in immigration detention’ (publishing.service.gov.uk)  [All News]"
Jesuit Refugee Service UK,A wonderful occasion to be together and celebrate the talents of our refugee friends,21-Dec-22,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/a-wonderful-occasion-to-be-together-and-celebrate-the-talents-of-our-refugee-friends/,"It’s not often that refugee friends, volunteers, staff, families and friends are actually all in the same space celebrating. However, the Advent Service 2022 provided the perfect occasion to bring all of the JRS community together in the setting of the beautiful Jesuit church at Farm Street in Mayfair. This year we were treated to something that our friends have been preparing for months, a fresh and original drama performance. None of us knew what to expect, though we knew that lots of work had gone into its preparation in the Creative Writing Group workshops during the last term. We were looking forward to it with a heightened interest and anticipation, and we were not disappointed! “Waiting” The dramatisation of JRS’s Creative Writing group produced a unique and captivating piece of theatrical art on the theme of “Waiting”. In their workshops over the past months, the group created characters which they explored as a group and then crafted beautiful, powerful poetry from the heart, which in turn they transformed into an act comprising recital and movement. The coordination between each of the actors and the movement as a whole was a testimony to the solidarity and collaboration of the group. Whilst the topic was a serious one, with clear messages about living life in limbo as a refugee currently in the UK, there was an undercurrent and sense of the fun and joy that they had shared in the process of creating something new together, which they could perform to a wider audience. It was a beautiful, powerful moment which spoke of the depth, dignity and suffering of each one, and it will stay with us. The group was facilitated by Laila Sumpton and Beth Organ, youcan read more about the process on our previous blog.  Donate to the JRS Advent Appeal Today  Joyous occasion Apart from the lustily sung traditional carols accompanied by excellent organ playing, inspiring homily, beautiful readings and intercessory prayers, we were able to able to gather for the traditional mulled wine and mince pies afterwards, for the first time since before the pandemic. There was much laughter and chat as everyone mingled and enjoyed seeing people in the flesh rather than on a computer screen. Everyone helped to make it a really smooth event  – and that sense of collaboration and team made it even more enjoyable. Rallying call Contemplating the joy of Christmas was the theme put to us by Fr Damian Howard SJ, Provincial of the Jesuits in Britain who presided the service. The joy of gazing at a new-born baby, who is God incarnate, dispels the fear that we might feel as we conjure in our imagination a portrayal of God as powerful, able to control, punish and destroy. Instead, God comes to us vulnerable and undefended, as a sweet baby. He himself is the gift, and in turn shows us human beings how to be gifts to one another. This is an invitation to be transformed. Fr Damian invited us to turn to look at the person in the pew next to us and ask ourselves: “How is this person a gift for me, and how can I be a gift for them?”. Is this the gift I have yet to unwrap? So often we are led to regard others as a threat rather than a gift: an ‘other’ whom we should fear and protect ourselves from, draw up our bridges and close our borders. The truth is rather that we are designed for encounter, connection and belonging. We are good news for each other and an opportunity for fulfilment. When governments propose “taking action which is cruel and will create misery for others, we have to stand up and tell the truth that sadism and exclusion will hurt us all” Fr Damian urged us. He reminded us that it’s not ok to be indifferent to people dying at sea, that we really need to care for those who seek our protection. This is our moral obligation. It was a wonderful Advent Service for everyone and a wonderful occasion to celebrate with our refugee friends. It is also our joy at JRS UK to try to fulfil the calling to stand up and tell the truth, to bear witness to the transformative power of Christmas joy as we journey with our refugee friends and we dream of life together in peace and joy, sharing all the goods of the earth.

Sarah Teather, JRS UK’s Director, said:“The government’s plans to force people who have fled war, persecution and violence on to planes to Rwanda is cruel.

Men, women, and age-disputed minors – children the government claims are adults – are among those being told they will be sent to Rwanda.[1]The government intends also to send families to Rwanda. Over the last several months, JRS UK has supported 28 men, including torture survivors, facing removal to Rwanda. “We have a responsibility to offer sanctuary to refugees. And yet the government is seeking to shirk that responsibility by forcing the transfer of asylum seekers to a much poorer and less stable country on another continent. We will continue to support asylum seekers placed in this awful situation and work with others try and bring the government to face its obligations.” In April 2022, the government announced plans to forcibly and permanently send some people who seek asylum in the UK toRwanda, under a newMigration and Economic Development Partnershipbetween the UK and Rwandan governments. As part of the plan, the Rwandan government will then have responsibility for their asylum claims. It will process their claims and, crucially,if they are recognised as refugees, they will stay in Rwanda. The scheme has been verywidely criticisedas carrying a high risk of human rights abuses, abrogating the UK’s responsibilities to refugees, and being both costly and ineffective. The human impact of banishing refugees to Rwanda: Daryan’s experience  A flight was scheduled to take people to Rwanda on 14thJune 2022. A number of attempts to stop it in UK courts had failed, but the European Court of Human Rights stopped the flightnoton the basis that the scheme was illegal, but on the basis that ongoing cases in the UK courts must be played outbeforethe flight could take place, as the outcome of these cases may have implications for the legality of the flight. Today,the High Court issued its rulingin one key case, and declared that the scheme was legal. The Court did, however, rule that the cases of 8 individual asylum seekers due to be sent to Rwanda had to be reconsidered, as they had not been examined properly in the first instance. Read more about JRS UK’s response to the Rwanda plan earlier this summer  When the plan was initially being set out, the Home Office official in charge of orchestrating the planrefused to sign off on itdue to lack of evidence that it would work, but then Home Secretary Priti Patel pushed forward with it by issuing a ministerial directive. As government policy and the national conversation around refugees becomes increasingly hostile and divisive, all of us at JRS need your support more than ever to enable us to increase our response, to fight for the rights of all refugees, and to give people the strength and confidence to build a new life in the UK.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,JRS UK excoriate Government’s latest announcement doubling down on plans to make asylum impossible,13-Dec-22,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/jrs-uk-excoriate-governments-latest-announcement-doubling-down-on-plans-to-make-asylum-impossible/,"In a Parliamentary Ministerial Statement today, 13thDecember, the Prime Minister dramatically announced government plans for further hostilities in the asylum system including: militarising the Channel, employing heavy-handed immigration enforcement in British communities; resuming data-sharing immigration enforcement agreements that were paused in the wake of the ‘Windrush’ scandal; expanding the use of institutional asylum accommodation; making it harder for victims of modern slavery to gain recognition; and imposing blanket refusals on Albanians seeking asylum. He concluded his announcement by reaffirming plans for new legislation that would deny asylum to anyone not coming through “safe and legal” routes. The announcement is the latest in a string of developments, including theNationality and Borders Act 2022, aimed at punishing refugees for how they travel to seek protection, creating barriers to asylum, and deepening the hostile environment, and follows a number of ministerial statements specifically attacking Albanian asylum seekers. Some opposition parliamentarians opined that the statements contained no genuine solutions to the backlog of asylum cases. Megan Knowles, JRS UK’s Interim Deputy Director, said: “Today, the government once again demonstrated its commitment to performative cruelty towards, and scapegoating of, refugees. This latest announcement follows decades of an asylum system that has let down refugees, and recent policy and legislation designed to punish them for the realities of being displaced. Our asylum system continually lets down people in need of protection. Finding more ways to criminalise, punish, and exclude refugees is a distraction from real issues – and it is a dangerous distraction for which human beings, our sisters and brothers, will pay the price.” The government’s announcement contrasts sharply with statements made by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a House of Lordsdebateon UK refugee and asylum policy on Friday. The Archbishop lamented successive government’s inhumane approach to refugees: “When we fail to challenge the harmful rhetoric that refugees are the cause of this country’s ills—that they should be treated as problems and not people, invaders to be tackled and deterred—we deny the essential value and dignity of fellow human beings. The right to seek asylum and the duty of the global community together to protect refugees has been politically degraded in this country, when it should be a positive source of pride.” He went on to excoriate the government’s policy to send refugees to Rwanda. Megan continued:“Refugees travel however they can, and there are vanishing formal ways to do so. The few formally recognised safe routes there are require someone to visit an embassy outside of the UK first. When hit, people fleeing for their lives aren’t able to stop off at embassies – we saw this as people fled Afghanistan, and continue to flee Ukraine.” The top nationalities of people making small boat crossings include Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria and Iran,according to Home Office statistics published in August 2022. In the year ending September 2022,according to government statistics, only 1,391 people were granted protection through resettlement schemes, which are only accessible to people from a handful of selected countries. The Home Secretary recentlyadmittedto the Home Affairs Select Committee that in many cases would have to come to the UK informally and claim asylum in order to get sanctuary here. Megan continued:“To deny asylum to people arriving informally – utilising incredible human strength and resilience – is to abandon our duty to refugees, and abandon our recognition of human dignity. To do so when there are no formal routes is not only doubly wrong – it is cravenly dishonest. Higher walls and policing and imprisoning people in search of safety will not stop them making dangerous journeys when they have no other choice.” Data-sharing between public and private bodies and immigration enforcement, and criminalisation of informal working, are part of the government’s longstanding policy to createa ‘hostile environment’for those refused asylum and those without immigration documents. Data-sharing with banks was specifically paused in the wake of the‘Windrush’scandal after it was revealed it had been instrumental in destroying the lives of many British citizens. On Friday, the Archbishop of Canterbury explicitly attacked the hostile environment, saying: “Recognition of human dignity is the first principle that must underpin our asylum policy. A hostile environment is an immoral environment.” As government policy and the national conversation around refugees becomes increasingly hostile and divisive, all of us at JRS need your support more than ever to enable us to increase our response, to fight for the rights of all refugees, and to give people the strength and confidence to build a new life in the UK.

Jesuit Refugee Service UK,14 December 2022 marks six months since the first flight to Rwanda was prevented from departing,13-Dec-22,https://www.jrsuk.net/news/14-december-2022-marks-six-months-since-the-first-flight-to-rwanda-was-prevented-from-departing/,"The JRS UK Detention Team were accompanying 28 men who were caught up in the UK’s new inadmissibility processes and were threatened with removal to Rwanda when the first flight was scheduled for departure on the 14thJune 2022. Due to the lack of accessible information, these men faced serious difficulties in receiving legal advice. During these intervening six months, refugee charities and individuals have challenged the Government’s Rwanda plan in the High Court claiming that the Home Office has adopted a procedure for sending people to Rwanda which is unlawful and unfair. JRS UK provided evidence to the case brought by Asylum Aid. All court hearings have now ended, and judgement is expected before Christmas. Read more about JRS UK’s response to the Rwanda plan earlier this summer The Government’s plan to banish people to Rwanda gives newly arrived asylum seekers just 7 (if in detention) or 14 days to understand what is happening to them, access legal advice, and put forward evidence and arguments as to why they should not be sent to Rwanda. If a decision is then made to send them to Rwanda, they have just 5 working days to get to court to stop their removal. The challenge to the Home Office was that 7-14 days was insufficient time for a person who has undergone an often-traumatic journey to understand what is happening, gain access to legal advice, and deal with all the complex issues arising. Extensions can be requested if more time is needed in a particular case, however, the Home Office does not tell asylum seekers that they can ask for more time if they need it. This information is not in the published guidance, or the ‘Notice of Intent’ issued to the newly-arrived refugee. In fact, the evidence presented to court showed that in some cases the Home Office did not respond to a request for an extension of time, and when it did, the extension of time was for a brief period which was still insufficient for a fair process. In short, the fear is that there is a real risk of people being put on a plane to Rwanda without a fair procedure being followed and without having a fair chance to properly make their case in court. Inhumanity of the Rwanda policy We know that those seeking asylum in the UK do so because they have family or friendship connections here and because we still have a reputation for fairness and decency. If we had to flee danger, war and famine, we too would wish to go to somewhere safe and trustworthy, where we might work and raise our family. The increasingly hostile environment is not an effective deterrent for people who are desperate to reach safety and rebuild their lives, it is a cynical, cruel, and unworkable plan. In a bid to bring some hope into this issue, we joined theTogether With Refugeescoalition to try to appeal to a better way forward and instead of shoddy, unworkable, expensive plans to send men, women and children to Rwanda, to rather #FillTheSkiesWithHope. To this end, we converted orange paper hearts into planes and filmed refugee friends, volunteers and staff, holding their heart and appealing to our MPs and government to “Have a heart for Refugees”. We now await the judgements from the High Court and we hope the courts will bring some humanity and common sense to bear on these inhumane plans, especially as we approach Christmas. In the meantime, please do join us with our efforts to #FillTheSkiesWithHope and ask your MP to have a heart for refugees.  Join JRS and #FillTheSkiesWithHope [All News]ECPAT UK"
ECPAT UK,Home Affairs Committee speaks out against Home Office treatment of migrant children and calls for increased care for child victims of trafficking in new report.,08-Dec-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/home-affairs-committee-speaks-out-against-home-office-treatment-of-migrant-children-and-calls-for-increased-care-for-child-victims-of-trafficking-in-new-report,"ECPAT UK has welcome d the report from t he H ome A ffairs Select Co mmittee published today following its inquiry into human trafficking. The Committee call s on the government to stop prioritising immigration enforcement at the expense of victims of human trafficking . The report also raise s specific concerns about the treatment of children , particularly the lack of trafficking specific support children receive following identification through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) . We agree with the report’s recommendation that t he Home Office and other public authorities treat human trafficking primarily a s a protection issue and the definition of human trafficking in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 be amended to remove the expectation that the exploitation ha s involved travel . The Committee c onclu des that the us e of hotels for unaccompanied children seeking asylum , which has result ed in hundreds of children going missing , is ‘unacceptable’ and left them at risk of trafficking and exploitatio n reflect ing the judgement handed down on the 27 July 2023 after ECPAT UK brought a claim of judicial review against Kent County Council (CC) and the Home Office. T h e number of children gone missing from the hotels is highlighted and members demand an update on progress made to find them by the end of the year. A strong recommendation is made to ensure that every child who goes missing from home or care is considered a potential victim of trafficking, even if they are subsequently found safe. Members conside r ed the roll out of the Independent Child Trafficking Guardians (ICTG) unacceptably slow , with only two thirds of local authorities in England and Wales currently covered . ECPAT UK also fin d s the decision to continue delaying this promise made to children eight years ago in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 outrageous , creating a post code lottery for children dependant of what area they are identified in . The committee called on local and central government to address the current gap in support when child victims of trafficking turn 18 and transition from child to adult services . C it ing evidence from ECPAT UK highlighting the sudden drop in support which can increase the risk of re-trafficking , it is recommend ed the Home Office a mend s its Modern Slavery statutory guidance to include a section on ‘turning 18’ as means to ensure that ageing out of the care system does not reduce support for recovery and prevention of re-trafficking. C hildren continue to be prosecuted for crimes committed as a result of exploitation, the report also found . I t should not be incumbent on children to raise their own defence under S ection 45 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 as the only means to secure protection from prosecution. ECPAT UK’s evidence to the committee also highlights how new provisions introduced by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the Illegal Migration Act 2023 disqualify children from identification if convicted of offences with a custodial sentence. These provisions will lead to increase criminalisation of child victims and further pena lties under immigration enforcement powers.

ECPAT UK,Judge rules that the Home Secretary acted irrationally in the case brought by Kent County Council on the operation of the National Transfer Scheme,28-Nov-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/judge-rules-that-the-home-secretary-acted-irrationally-in-the-case-brought-by-kent-county-council-on-the-operation-of-the-national-transfer-scheme,"Th e High Court has ruled that the Home Secretary acted irrationally in its operation of the National Transfer Scheme in a further judgement about the accommodation of unaccompanied children in Home Office hotels. The use of hotels for unaccompanied children was found unlawful in the judgement handed down on the 27 July 2023 after ECPAT UK brought a claim of judicial review against Kent C ounty C ouncil (CC) and the Home Office . T he High Court also found that K ent CC acted in breach of its Children Act 1989 duties by failing to accommodate and look after all unaccompanied children seeking asylum when notified of their arrival. In th is further judgement , Brighton & Hove County Council and East Sussex County Council , joined as interested parties . Mr Justice Chamberlain dismissed four out of the five grounds , finding that they were not well founded as to the use of the Home Office’s statutory powers, the inconsistency of the NTS protocol and their duties to safeguard the welfare of children. The f ifth ground brough t by Kent CC was allowed , with the judgement setting out that the Home Secretary’s decision-making in relation to the NTS was irrational because it failed to accept and account of its responsib ility in : the fact that the agreement with Kent (the Protocol) was partly responsible for Kent CC’s unlawful failure to discharge the Child ren Act 1 989 duties to take unaccompanied children into care and that the use of hotels had by December 20 2 1 become systematic, routine and therefore unlawful. T he J udge high lighted that both K ent CC and the Home Office used the same arguments from previous hearings , despite the determinations of illegality in the ECPAT UK decision , inducing a sense of ‘déjà vu ’ . He castigated K ent CC ’s claim that they had been ‘forced’ to refuse unaccompanied children care o n arrival in their area because of Home Office failures . S imilarly , he rejected the Home Office ’s insiste nce on the ‘need’ to resort to hotels because of Kent CC ’s unlawful refusal to discharge its Children Act 1989 duties. ECPAT UK has always been concerned that b oth parties relied on these symbiotic arguments and did so again in this case , despite the previous judgement clearly setting out the ir illegality . Mr Justice Chamberlain also set s out the requirement for a plan to prevent the further use of hotels to accommodate unaccompanied children, subject to any decisions that the Home Secretary may take about the implementation of new powers in the Illegal Migration Act 2023. T he minimum requirements of such a plan should be that it is lawful and that it recogni s es the Home Secretary’s own responsibility for the unlawful situation identified in the ECPAT UK, R (On the Application Of) v Kent County Council & Anor [2023] EWHC 1953 (Admin) decision ensur ing that it does not recur . A further hearing to consider relief on this case has been fixed for 15 December 2023. Patricia Durr , CEO of Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (ECPAT UK) said : “ We welcome this further judgement about the treatment and care of unaccompanied children. The High Court has made clear once again that it is not acceptable to put the welfare of children outside of the laws that parliament has made to protect them. The Children Act 1989 is a legal landmark in the UK’s respect for children’s rights, welfare and protection without discrimination – that the High Court consistently upholds this is a clear message to central and local government that every child matters and that they should work together to uphold that principle - nothing less is acceptable. ECPAT UK will also continue to fight for the rights of every child in the UK to live free from exploitation and to ensure all children can access the care they are entitled to under the statutory child protection legislation . The unlawful and unsafe use of hotels to accommodate unaccompanied children is a national child protection scandal and should never occur again. We remain concerned about the children who are still missing as a result of this illegality and will continue to call for all measures to find them , as well as a public inquiry to find out what happened . Provisions in the Illegal Migration Act 2023 will mean more children are put a t risk . W e call on the new Home Secretary to reject the m and to prioritise children’s welfare and safety. ” ECPAT UK is represented by Martin Westgate KC, Shu Shin Luh and Antonia Benfield of Doughty Street Chambers and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.

ECPAT UK,King’s Speech announces new laws to tackle online child exploitation whilst reconfirming the UK government’s desire to remove the rights of child victims,08-Nov-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/kings-speech-announces-new-laws-to-tackle-online-child-exploitation-whilst-reconfirming-the-uk-governments-desire-to-remove-the-rights-of-child-victims,"In the King’s Speech on 7 th November 2023 , the government committed to introducing further legislation to prevent new and complex digital crimes, including online child sexual abuse. Following the passing of the landmark Online Safety Act 2023 , we welcome the government’s continued commitment to protecting children online. We expect ambitious aims from the relevant government departments now tasked with implementing the commitments made in this legislation. We also urge increased efforts to particularly target the rise in live streaming the sexual abuse of children abroad by people in the UK. We are very concerned that during the speech the government’s ambition to implement measures in the Illegal Migration Act 2023 was reinforced, an act that sets out the most significant departure from the UK government’s commitments to uphold the rights of children. The implementation of the Illegal Migration Act is act will: · reverse the 2010 commitment by the government to end child detention, revoking the 24-hour time limit to detain unaccompanied children, to be replaced with limitless powers to detain · render the asylum claims of any unaccompanied child arriving irregularly or with a fraudulent visa (a common feature in many cases of child trafficking) inadmissible, making them subject to removal as soon as their turn 18 · deny protections to victims of trafficking and their children such as access to accommodation and support or leave to remain, leaving victims in destitution and unable to support investigations and prosecutions of the serious offences committed against them. The Illegal Migration Act also introduces wide powers to the Home Office to accommodate unaccompanied children, a practice deemed unlawful by the court since December 2021 in the case ECPAT UK brought against Kent County Council and the Secretary of State for the Home Department . This legislation profoundly undermines the duties in our child protection framework and if implemented, will create a segregated system solely on the basis of the child’s immigration status. It will also give rise to more unnecessary legal challenges. Following these announcements, the Prime Minister appointed James Cleverly as the Home Secretary who will oversee these significant attacks on children’s rights. We urge the Home Secretary to reconsider the retrograde direction of his department and ensure all children in the UK are treated equally and their rights to protection and care are respected.

ECPAT UK,ECPAT UK welcomes the announcement of a new Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner,11-Oct-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/new-anti-slavery-commissioner-announced-after-18-month-vacancy,"ECPAT UK has welcome the announcement of the appointment of Eleanor Lyons as the new UK Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. The appointment follows 18 months without a person in the important statutory role. Ms Lyons is currently Deputy to the Children's Commissioner for England and was selected by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman. The appointment comes after a significant void in the independence, advocacy and focus that the role brings. During that time the UK Government made significant changes to its treatment of victims of modern slavery and trafficking including implementation of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the passing of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 , effectively removing protection for victims and contrary to international law. The role of the Commissioner established by the Modern Slavery Act 2015, is independent of government and its function as set out in Part 4 of the Act is to encourage good practice in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of slavery and human trafficking offences and the identification of victims, having regard to assist and support to them. The work includes making report, recommendations, research, information, education or training, consultation and collaboration in the UK and internationally and the Commissioner is accountable through a strategic plan and annual reports which are laid before Parliament. Ms Lyons will commence the role on 11 December 2023 for a fixed period of three years. Patricia Durr, CEO of ECPAT UK said: ""After so long with this critical statutory role vacant, ECPAT UK welcomes the appointment of a new Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. We look forward to working with Eleanor Lyons and trust that with all of her work supporting the Children’s Commissioner for England she will have a clear focus on the human rights of victims of modern slavery and of the particular needs and experiences of children in the face of the myriad forms of child exploitation. The independence of this role is critical and there is much to be done to reinforce the premise and ambitions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the principles of children’s welfare, safeguarding and protection enshrined in both international and domestic law.""

ECPAT UK,High Court orders Home Office to transfer unaccompanied children from hotels into care,03-Oct-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/high-court-orders-home-office-to-transfer-unaccompanied-children-from-hotels-into-care,"The Home Office must take all possible steps to transfer all unaccompanied children seeking asylum currently in Home Office hotels to local authority care by 22 September 2023, Mr Justice Chamberlain has ordered. The order follows a further High Court hearing in the case of ECPAT UK v Kent County Council and Secretary of State For The Home Department [2023] EWHC 1953 (Admin) Case held on 15 September. The judge also ordered that if children are placed in a hotel after 22 September, the Home Office must take all steps to transfer them within 5 working days into care. It was confirmed at the hearing that the government has proposed to give Kent County Council £9.75 million immediate cash injection to support its discharge of Children Act 1989 duties and that a sustainable plan and funding model is to be agreed as soon as possible. At the hearing, the Home Office said that there were 106 children being accommodated in hotels in Kent at that point - of which 83 were under 16 and the youngest child 13 years old. The Home Office confirmed that since the 18 August, 2 children have gone missing. The judge has also granted East Sussex County Council leave to join the claims as an interested party. Martin Westgate KC, for ECPAT UK , said in the hearing that unaccompanied children seeking asylum “have continued to be accommodated in hotels in numbers that have barely changed since the last hearing”. “It is a cause for particular concern that a significant majority of them are under 16 and this appears to be a deterioration from the previous position,” he added. Another hearing will be held to determine further relief following the decision in the claim made by Kent County Council against the Home Office concerning its operation of the National Transfer Scheme (NTS) which is to be held on 10 October. ECPAT UK is not a party to, and therefore did not seek permission from the judge to make submissions in, that claim. Patricia Durr, CEO of ECPAT UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking), said: “It is well over two years since this unlawful practice began, a practice that has denied thousands of children protection and care and left them vulnerable to exploitation, with many going missing. As the judgement and the court order makes clear, this practice must end and children’s rights and welfare under the Children Act 1989 must be respected. It is concerning that continued court oversight is necessary to ensure that it does, but it is clear that it has prompted a change and we hope that continues so that the differential treatment of children arriving here with no parent or carer ends, as the law demands.” ECPAT UK is represented by Martin Westgate KC, Shu Shin Luh and Antonia Benfield of Doughty Street Chambers and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.

ECPAT UK,High Court retains oversight of the treatment of unaccompanied children,24-Aug-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/high-court-retains-oversight-of-the-treatment-of-unaccompanied-children,"Following a further High Court hearing in the case of ECPAT UK v Kent County Council and Secretary of State For The Home Department [2023] EWHC 1953 (Admin) Case held on 17 th August 2023, Mr Justice Chamberlain has declared that Kent County Council (Kent CC) was and is acting unlawfully, in breach of its duties under the Children Act 1989, by failing to accommodate, and then look after, all unaccompanied children notified to them by the Home Office.  This declaration asserts the key tenet of the judgement served on 27 th July. The Judge held it was necessary to mark Kent CC’s unlawful conduct by a specific declaration given that the local authority continues to turn away newly arrived unaccompanied children who are otherwise entitled to be looked after by the local authority. Further to the previous order of the court dated 1 st August, the agreement between Kent CC and the SSHD known as ‘the Kent Protocol’ which permitted a cap on the numbers of newly arrived unaccompanied children for which Kent CC took responsibility, is now quashed. Evidence given at the hearing was that a number of children were still in hotels awaiting transfer to the care of a local authority so the court has  ordered a further suspension of its quashing of the National Transfer Scheme Protocol in so far as it permits the Home Secretary to make arrangements for the direct transfer of children to local authority care, to allow for those remaining children to be transferred.  The suspension is once again subject to conditions which include that children should be transferred within 5 working days. Mr Justice Chamberlain has ordered a further hearing to take place on 15 th September to consider evidence to be filed by both defendants that all steps have been taken to ensure that each unaccompanied child arriving in Kent is accommodated and looked after by Kent County Council under the Children Act 1989 and that the conditions of the suspended order have been complied with. The court will also examine whether and to what extent Kent CC is treating unaccompanied children differently by refusing to take them into care whilst continuing to accept their duties to other children. Patricia Durr, CEO of ECPAT UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking), said: “We are pleased that the High Court has made another order in this case and that it continues to retain oversight of the implementation of its judgement, to ensure that children currently in hotels are safely looked after by local authorities under the Children Act 1989 and that neither central nor local government departments act outside of the statutory child welfare framework and duties towards all children under The Children Act 1989. Notwithstanding, it should not be necessary. It is shocking that it has taken litigation by a small charity like ours to end the unlawful practice of the Home Secretary and Kent County Council, which has meant thousands of children denied care on the basis of their immigration status and too many remain missing at risk of significant harm as a result. We will continue to defend the rights of every child in the UK to live free from exploitation and to access the care and protection they are entitled to under the law.” ECPAT UK is represented by Martin Westgate KC, Shu Shin Luh and Antonia Benfield of Doughty Street Chambers and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. —ENDS— Notes to editors: ECPAT UK press contact: [email protected] and 020 7607 2136 Charities wrote to Ministers to highlight these concerns as early as 2021 Previous ECPAT UK report from June 2022 highlighted these concerns Charities letter to the Prime Minster in January 2023 Children’s charities including the NSPCC and Barnardos wrote a joint statement calling for care for every child in need under the Children Act 1989 in March 2023 High Court judgement in the case: ECPAT UK v Kent County Council and Secretary of State For The Home Department [2023] EWHC 1953 (Admin) Case Published: 24 th August, 2023 Updated: 4 th October, 2023 Author: Patricia Durr Share this page Email Facebook Twitter"
ECPAT UK,ECPAT UK wins legal challenge on the unlawful accommodation of unaccompanied children,27-Jul-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/ecpat-uk-wins-legal-challenge,"The High Court has today found that Kent County Council has acted in breach of its Children Act 1989 duties by failing to accommodate and look after all unaccompanied children seeking asylum when notified of their arrival. The High Court has also found the Secretary of State for the Home Department to have acted unlawfully in routinely and systematically accommodating newly arrived unaccompanied children in hotels, denying them the protection of a local authority corporate parent. These important findings, set out in a judgment handed down today by Mr. Justice Chamberlain, followed an application for judicial review by ECPAT UK of the treatment of unaccompanied children made on the 9 th June 2023. Permission was granted to ECPAT UK on 7 July 2023 for an urgent hearing of the issues. This outcome confirms what ECPAT UK has consistently said, that this practice of housing unaccompanied children who arrive in the UK entirely outside any statutory child protection safeguards, is unlawful and cannot be described as an emergency response two years on. With many other children's and refugee charities ECPAT UK has consistently called for an end to normalising the systematic and unlawful denial of protection to children on arrival. A High Court judge has agreed and confirmed ECPAT UK’s long-held position and condemned the practice as exceeding the proper limit of the Home Secretary’s powers. The judgment reaffirms the primacy of duties owed by local authorities to all children who require looking after, irrespective of their immigration status, movingly emphasising in his judgment that: ‘Ensuring the safety and welfare of children with no adult to look after them is among the most fundamental duties of any civilised state. In the United Kingdom, this duty is imposed on local authorities.’ In so finding, the judge unequivocally restated the legal obligations that local authorities owe to children housed in hotels in their areas, including the obligation to take all necessary steps to safeguard their welfare and safety by exercising their duties under Part 3 of The Children Act 1989, to assess their needs and to provide them with suitable accommodation and other support and protection measures. The collective and individual failures committed by Kent County Council and the Secretary of State resulted in hundreds of children going missing and many trafficked for criminal exploitation. The High Court is due to decide, at today’s hearing (27 th July 2023) what the council and the Secretary of State must now do to urgently remedy their unlawful acts so that unaccompanied children arriving in the UK will not continue to suffer the same detriment. Patricia Durr, CEO of ECPAT UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking), said: “This judgement powerfully reaffirms the primacy of the Children Act 1989 and our child welfare statutory framework which does not allow for children to treated differently because of their immigration status. It remains a child protection scandal that so many of the most vulnerable children remain missing at risk of significant harm as a consequence of these unlawful actions by the Secretary of State and Kent County Council. Despite the recent passing of the Illegal Migration Act 2023, which will deny unaccompanied children the right to claim asylum, amongst other hugely damaging provisions, this judgement serves as a clear and timely reminder that neither central nor local government departments can depart from the statutory child welfare framework and the duties towards all children under The Children Act 1989. We will continue to defend the rights of every child in the UK to live free from exploitation and access the care they are entitled to under the law.” Ali Sallaway and Chris Pugh, leading the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP team said: “It has been a privilege to represent ECPAT UK in this important case.  Their commitment to the children affected has been unwavering, and we welcome the clarity provided by the High Court.  The onus is now on the Home Office and Kent County Council to put in place a system at speed which ensures that their respective legal obligations towards UAS children are now met going forwards.  This was a team effort and we are grateful to our counsel team, Martin Westgate KC, Richard Drabble KC, Shu Shin Luh, and Antonia Benfield.” ECPAT UK was represented by Martin Westgate KC, Shu Shin Luh and Antonia Benfield of Doughty Street Chambers and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. —ENDS— Notes to editors: ECPAT UK press contact: [email protected] and 020 7607 2136 Charities wrote to Ministers to highlight these concerns as early as 2021 Previous ECPAT UK report from June 2022 highlighted these concerns Charities letter to the Prime Minster in January 2023 Children’s charities including the NSPCC and Barnardos wrote a joint statement calling for care for every child in need under the Children Act 1989 in March 2023 High Court judgement in the case ECPAT UK v Kent County Council and Secretary of State For The Home Department [2023] EWHC 1953 (Admin) Case Published: 27 th July, 2023 Updated: 31 st July, 2023 Author: Laura Duran Share this page Email Facebook Twitter"

ECPAT UK,ECPAT UK Youth Advisory Group writes to parliamentarians about the risks to children in the Illegal Migration Bill,28-Jun-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/ecpat-uk-youth-advisory-group-writes-to-parliamentarians-to-warn-about-the-risks-to-children-and-to-urge-them-to-vote-against-the-illegal-migration-bill-ahead-of-house-of-lords-debate,"ECPAT UK Youth Advisory Group have written a letter to parliamentarians to warn about the risks to children and to urge them to vote against the Illegal Migration Bill ahead of House of Lords debate “All of us just want to be and to feel safe and the hope of a better future. Don't use our vulnerability as young people to take that away. Stand with us, not against us in the face of cruelty and criminality.  Focus on tackling the criminals, not punishing the victims.” Young people who arrived in the UK unaccompanied and who have experienced modern slavery have written to parliamentarians to share their own experiences and to urge them to protect children in votes on the Illegal Migration Bill In a letter, members of ECPAT UK’s Youth Advisory Group warn that the measures in the bill will leave children unsafe and at risk of trafficking and retrafficking Highlighting the ways in which the bill removes children’s rights to protection, to make an asylum application or to be considered for immigration leave as a victim of trafficking, young people ask parliamentarians to think about themselves as children or their own children and to vote against the measures Young people also highlight that the measures will only make children feel unsafe, further traumatised and fearful Young people have written to parliamentarians ahead of today’s first Report Stage debate on the Illegal Migration Bill in the House of Lords. The letter comes following widespread concerns about the impact of the Bill on children and other vulnerable groups from a number of bodies including the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child , the Joint Committee on Human Rights , the Children’s Commissioner for England , the Women and Equalities Committee , UN Special Rapporteurs , the Association of Directors of Children’s Services and many charities and organisations concerned with children’s welfare and protection. Measures in the bill will mean a reversal of the 2010 commitment by the government, enacted into law in 2014, to end child detention. This landmark achievement stopped the routine detention of thousands of children and families for immigration purposes – a practice recognised as ‘state-sponsored cruelty.  They also include refusing to consider the claims made by unaccompanied children for international protection, no matter which country they have come from, rolling back protections the UK has put in place to safeguard children seeking safety alone with the threat of deportation when they reach 18 years. The bill is also an affront to the protections the UK should provide unaccompanied children and child victims of trafficking under the European Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Children Act 1989, leaving them at greater risk of abuse and duties to safeguard children are undermined Members of ECPAT UK’s Youth Advisory Group said: “We are very worried about unaccompanied children coming to the UK now and since 7 th March 2023. We are concerned that they will not receive the right support and will not be safe and that many will go missing and may be trafficked or retrafficked.  Plans to deny the right to claim asylum or leave to remain as a victim of trafficking, to detain young people, to accommodate children in hotels without care, to return them to unsafe places that they were forced to leave in the first place or to deport them to somewhere they don’t know will leave them unsafe, traumatised and fearful.” Patricia Durr, CEO ECPAT UK said: ""It has been very upsetting for our Youth Advisory Group to consider the proposals in the Illegal Migration Bill because they understand so acutely what this means for children and young people and the risks and dangers to them. It is not easy for child victims of trafficking to speak out but when they do it is important that they are heard and listened to. We can see already the outcomes for children when their rights and the hard won duties towards them are discarded: 154 children are still missing from Home Office run hotels with evidence that children have been harmed and exploited.” “I urge all parliamentarians to think about the impact on children and to stand up for children’s rights when they consider how they will vote on this bill. The rollback on human rights and child protection cannot be allowed to continue unchecked.” ---ENDS--- Notes: The text of the letter can be found here The Illegal Migration Bill so far has 3 days of Report Stage in the House of Lords on 28 June, 3 July and 5 July ECPAT UK has been working with the Refugee and Migrant Children’s Consortium and a range of organisations to provide briefings at each stage of the Bill ECPAT UK has also recently launched a legal challenge about the practice of the Home Office directly accommodating unaccompanied children in hotels outside of the framework of the Children Act 1989 Published: 28 th June, 2023 Updated: 16 th February, 2024 Author: Patricia Durr Share this page Email Facebook Twitter"
ECPAT UK,ECPAT UK launches legal challenge to Kent County Council and the Home Secretary on the accommodation of unaccompanied children,11-Jun-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/ecpat-uk-launches-legal-challenge,"ECPAT UK launches legal challenge against Kent County Council and the Secretary of State for the Home Department on the accommodation of unaccompanied children in Home Office hotels. ECPAT UK launches legal challenge on the continued practice by the Home Office of unlawfully placing unaccompanied children in hotels ECPAT UK also challenges Kent County Council’s derogation of duties towards children in need With over 150 children who remain missing from these hotels and 5,570 accommodated there so far, this practice must end. The Home Office continues to unlawfully accommodate unaccompanied children in hotels. This is despite significant media attention earlier this year, following an investigation by The Observer, revealing children have been emotionally abused by hotel staff and that of those known to have gone missing, some were subjected to human trafficking . ECPAT UK’s case asserts there is no legal basis for Kent County Council to derogate from their duties and obligations to children in need and that the Home Office has no authority to place them in hotels. Important statutory measures are in place under the Children Act 1989 which underpins the child welfare and child protection legal framework. This legislation ensures that children who do not have parents or other responsible adults to look after them have their needs properly identified, met and protected by local authorities. In January over 100 charities from the children and refugee sectors wrote to the Prime Minister to express their grave concern about unaccompanied children going missing from Home Office hotels. ECPAT UK has attempted through every available means to persuade Ministers and government departments to end this unlawful practice. Despite these steps, the government continues to refuse to commit to an exit strategy and instead is attempting to legislate to give the Home Office powers to accommodate children in the Illegal Migration Bill. For the first time in its history, ECPAT UK is taking steps to legally challenge the government and Kent County Council to uphold the rights of children. The charity has instructed the firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP who have instructed Richard Drabble KC from Landmark Chambers, Shu Shin Luh and Antonia Benfield from Doughty Street Chambers. Figures shared by the Minister in this week’s House of Lords debate on the Illegal Migration Bill show the scale of this continuing harmful practice. 5,570 children have been accommodated in Home Office hotels so far, and the whereabouts of 154 of the more than 400 children who have gone missing are still unknown. It has recently come to light that there is an agreement between Kent County Council, the Department for Education and the Home Office which sanctions the abdication of responsibility by Kent County Council to perform their mandatory duties to unaccompanied children. This agreement has been in place since September 2021, completely devoid of public knowledge or scrutiny. ECPAT UK remains deeply concerned that children are being directly accommodated by the Home Office outside of local authority care and denied the statutory care and protection to which Parliament has long decided that they are entitled. It is a matter of significant public importance that every child in the UK is treated without discrimination and can practicably access their rights regardless of their immigration status. Patricia Durr, CEO of ECPAT UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking), said: “This is a national child protection scandal that we cannot allow to continue. As a small charity concerned with the rights of some of the most vulnerable children subject to the very worst crimes, we have been left with no choice.  Children have been harmed, children are missing, and children have been exploited.” “It is the shocking but inevitable consequence of Kent County Council abdicating their obligations with the sanction of the Home Office, which itself is operating outside of the law. It is clear the Home Office has no authority, power, or expertise to accommodate vulnerable children. It is abhorrent that instead of upholding the rights of all children, the government is seeking to legislate to seize powers under the Illegal Migration Bill. Our domestic law and our international obligations demand that children are treated without discrimination and in their best interests, regardless of who they are, where they came from or how they got here”. “The Children Act 1989, enshrined in law by a Conservative administration with cross-party support is the bedrock of our commitment to children and we will not allow it to be dismantled.” “Despite evidence of the significant harm suffered by many unaccompanied children, the government has opted to entrench this discriminatory practice in law leaving traumatised and separated children without the protection to which they are entitled under the Children Act 1989 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This cannot and will not be tolerated.” —ENDS— Notes to editors: ECPAT UK press contact: [email protected] and 020 7607 2136 Charities wrote to Ministers to highlight these concerns as early as 2021 Previous ECPAT UK report from June 2022 highlighted these concerns Charities letter to the Prime Minster in January 2023 Children’s charities including the NSPCC and Barnardos wrote a joint statement calling for care for every child in need under the Children Act 1989 in March 2023 Recent judgement in the Family Court Division of the High Court confirms that unaccompanied children have the same rights under Children Act 1989 and that the Home Office practice does not change local authority duties towards them Published: 11 th June, 2023 Updated: 28 th July, 2023 Author: Patricia Durr Share this page Email Facebook Twitter"

ECPAT UK,Care for every child: Duties to care for children must apply equally to all children,08-Mar-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/care-for-every-child,"Joint statement in response to the Illegal Migration Bill Children's charities including NSPCC, Barnardo's, Action for Children, The Children's Society and National Children's Bureau coordinated by Children England and ECPAT UK condemn proposals set out in the Illegal Migration Bill to create a segregated system of care for unaccompanied children outside of local authority social care duties under our child welfare legislation in the Children Act 1989 Every child is unique, special and equally entitled to our respect, care and protection, no matter who they are, where they were born or how they came to be in a particular part of the UK. The Children Act 1989 is the legal foundation for protecting all children in England and Wales equally. Removing any group of children from any of its provisions profoundly undermines it, and creates an unacceptable segregation between those children who are entitled to the full care, support and protection of children’s legislation and other children who have been placed outside of it. To remove rights for some children is to deny the intrinsic rights of all children. Through the Illegal Migration Bill the Home Secretary plans to seek a range of powers in respect of unaccompanied children which gravely concern us, including powers to directly accommodate them on arrival and subsequently transfer them. This legal change would leave some of the world’s most vulnerable children outside of the very system designed to give children in their circumstances a home, safety, recovery from their trauma and support to reach their unique potential. As children’s organisations we disagree in principle with this prospect, out of profound concern for the children it would affect, and for the long term implications of undermining the universality of protection provided by the Children Act 1989, and the UK’s fulfilment of its international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The practice of the Home Office putting unaccompanied children in hotels, from which hundreds are disappearing, must stop. Attempting to set it on more solid footing through legislation runs counter to the Government’s commitment to end the use of hotels and will only worsen and prolong the huge child protection failure already unfolding. Many of us have warned since 2021 against this dangerous temporary measure, recognising that the real solution is to invest in local authorities so that they can fulfil their duties to these children under the Children Act. Two years later, hundreds of children have gone missing from Home Office-run hotels, and over 200 remain untraceable. The Home Office has not only failed to ensure children have the health, education and legal support1 that a corporate parent is required to provide, but it has lost many of the children in its ‘care’, and appears unwilling to take responsibility for finding them2 . We will resist any attempt to formalise such practices and we are united in urging that the Government instead focuses on ending the use of hotels altogether, finding the missing children, and resourcing councils properly to provide the standards of care and protection to which every child is entitled.

ECPAT UK,"Over 100 charities call for action on children going missing from Home Office hotels, at risk of trafficking and exploitation",26-Jan-23,https://www.ecpat.org.uk/news/charities-call-for-action-on-children-missing-in-hotels,"Charities including NSPCC, Barnardo’s, The Children’s Society, ECPAT UK and the Refugee Council have written to the Prime Minister Hundreds of children have gone missing from hotels and are suspected of being trafficked and exploited The Home Office is unlawfully housing separated children in unsafe hotels, where they could be targeted by criminals Over 100 charities from the refugee and children’s sectors have written to the Prime Minister today to express their grave concern about separated children seeking asylum going missing from Home Office hotels. The children are suspected of being exploited and are accommodated outside of the UK’s child welfare framework which applies to all children, regardless of their immigration status. In the open letter coordinated by ECPAT UK and the Refugee Council, charities including major UK children’s charities NSPCC, Barnardo’s, Action for Children, Coram, The Children’s Society and National Children’s Bureau, are calling for the Home Office to stop accommodating separated children in hotels with no further delays. They are also calling for children to be cared for by local authority children’s social care, according to the law and with all the safeguards that brings, including having OFSTED oversight, and for an urgent independent inquiry: We request the end to this practice immediately with a commitment to an end date after which these practices will not be revived and an urgent independent inquiry given these significant matters of public concern following the reported failures to protect vulnerable children from harm. The charities have denounced the continued use of unsafe hotels by the Home Office to accommodate separated children, arguing the practice is unlawful and harmful: There is no legal basis for placing children in Home Office hotel accommodation and almost two years into the operation of the scheme which is both unlawful and harmful, it is no longer possible to justify the use of hotels as being ‘temporary’. It is a significant departure from the Children Act 1989 and established standards. Charities have previously issued multiple warnings to Ministers and government departments about the dangers of the Home Office accommodating children in these hotels. The latest revelations of children going missing surfaced last weekend, with over 100 children found to have been reported missing from a single Sussex hotel, with 79 who remain missing. The government confirmed that there were 440 occurrences of children having gone missing from hotels, and 200 children have never been found. The letter highlights the government’s continued failure to end the harmful practice: While the use of hotels for separated children was initially characterised by the Home Office as an “emergency” measure to be operated for “the very shortest of periods”, it has continued for some 18 months. Notwithstanding the unlawfulness of the practice and the hundreds of children that have gone missing and/or been abducted, the Home Office has repeatedly failed to commit to an end date for housing children in this way – despite a recommendation from the ICIBI in October 2022 to end these practices within six months. Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “We know from our work that children who have experienced unimaginable horror and upheaval coming to our country in search of safety are highly traumatised and vulnerable. Government has a very clear legal duty to protect them but is failing to do so with the equivalent of several classrooms of children seemingly having disappeared into the clutches of those who will exploit and abuse them. This is a child protection scandal that councils the police and ministers must urgently address to ensure every single separated child matters and is kept safe.” Patricia Durr, CEO of ECPAT UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking), said: “This is a national child protection failure - the shocking but inevitable consequence of the Home Office practice of directly accommodating separated children outside of the law. The Home Office has no authority, power or expertise in the care and protection of children. “Despite evidence of the risks and numerous representations, the government has ignored the warnings and is yet to commit to an exit strategy, seeming to prefer to entrench this discriminatory approach to some of the most vulnerable children with the greatest need of protection and care. “We need an urgent commitment to end this practice immediately and to ensure that separated children are cared for and protected as all other children within our legal and well-established child welfare framework.  Rather than setting up separate provision, the government must provide local authorities with sufficient funds to properly fulfil their legal duties to children.” —ENDS— Notes to editors: Refugee Council press office: [email protected] and 020 7346 1214.

Why challenge notice to move to the Bibby Stockholm Barge? From our extensive experience with the asylum support system, we know that the Bibby Stockholm is a precarious, unsustainable stopgap that will only exacerbate the harms of the hostile environment . No amount of repurposing can make the Bibby Stockholm safe or suitable as accommodation. That’s why it is crucial that individuals who have been instructed to return to the Bibby Stockholm Barge have access to clear, accurate information on how to challenge the notice should they wish to do so. How can you show solidarity with people instructed to move to the Bibby Stockholm? Please share this guide in your network to help make sure impacted individuals have this information. Use the hashtag #NoFloatingPrisons and stay informed with updates from Migrants Organise on social media and via email . If you are in London and interested in community organising work around the issue of housing and asylum support accommodation, please contact us . The Bibby Stockholm is unsafe and unsuitable. What we urgently need is community-based housing infrastructure to truly support and welcome people into our communities. Our position is informed by direct work with impacted individuals and organisers in Portland, and is reflected in our ongoing legal work around the Bibby Stockholm and housing under the hostile environment.

Illustration by Esme Hemmings Studio Migrants Organise came to life through gatherings in North Kensington living rooms, where migrant and refugee leaders would provide advice and support to their communities. The organisation became known as the The Refugees and Migrant Communities Forum (The Forum) and then in 2015 Migrants Organise. Since 1993, we grew and transformed,  into the organisation we are today: a platform where refugees and migrants organise for power, dignity and justice. Support us to continue our work for the next 30 years Our daily work combines advice and support for individuals at the sharp end of the  hostile environment immigration policies with community organising, advocacy, research and campaigning to help dismantle structural racism. In reflecting upon our history and looking ahead to the future, it is clear our greatest achievement will always be the solidarity we have built together with our community, made up of people like you. Donate to Migrants Organise Thank you for being on this journey with Migrants Organise. Together, we will keep standing up for a world where every person lives in dignity and justice.

Migrants Organise,#EndColonialComplicity: Palestine Solidarity Statement,10-Nov-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/endcolonialcomplicity-palestine-solidarity-statement/,"Migrant and Anti-Racist Community Groups in Britain: Stop the ethnic cleansing in Palestine, and end Britain’s colonial complicity in crimes against the Palestinian people We are writing, as Black, brown, migrant and racialised groups in Britain, united in our shared struggle for justice and freedom, to demand an immediate end to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, unrestricted humanitarian access and an end to the British complicity making Israel’s war crimes possible. We stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle against settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing, and join the many calls to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people enshrined in international law. The scale of the assault currently being waged against the Palestinian people is reminiscent in intent and brute force of the ethnic cleansing and mass expulsion that took place during the Nakba or ‘Catastrophe’ of 1948, in which more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced, dispossessed and expelled from their homes. Since launching its war on Gaza – the 6th major assault on its people since the illegal blockade was imposed – Israel has, as of 10 November 2023, killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, including four thousand children, and injured more than 22,000. Many thousands remain hidden under rubble, without hope of being saved as the carpet bombing continues. Over one million Palestinians have been made homeless – the majority already refugees. Water, food, electricity and all humanitarian assistance has all been cut off, with the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other international bodies describing ‘an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe’, that is both ‘inhumane’ and tantamount to a ‘death sentence’. Meanwhile, at least 130 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers since the start of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, and more than 5,000 arrested as they continue to resist apartheid and settler violence in what was already the deadliest year to date for Palestinians in the West Bank. The unqualified support of the British government and opposition for Israel’s horrifying war crimes and crimes against humanity, which many human rights organisations are now describing as acts of genocide, are a dark legacy of British colonialism. The history of British sponsored dispossession is one we are familiar with. Many of us currently living in Britain arrived fleeing the wars, poverty and economic devastation imposed on the majority of the world’s population by British, European and US imperialism, just as our ancestors before us fled the massacres, enslavement, and famines of the British Empire. Britain carries an outstanding and ongoing colonial debt it has yet to settle with all the peoples of the countries it once colonised, including the Palestinian people. This is all the more obvious as Britain this week dispatches warships to join US fleets, in active collaboration with Israel’s war crimes, endorsing and overseeing accelerated ethnic cleansing in Palestine. In recent days we have witnessed an acceleration of Britain’s campaign to exclude and criminalise the participation in public life of Palestinians and those who stand in solidarity with them. Defamed and dehumanised in the media and by politicians, Palestinians have experienced increased harassment and detention by police, and expressions of their national identity, including the Palestinian flag, have been threatened with criminalisation. We recognise and identify the many attempts, small and large, to denigrate Palestinians in Britain, suppress their voice and make them invisible. As racialised and migrant communities, we reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access. We also pledge, to ourselves and the communities we work with, to unite in a common struggle to challenge and dismantle imperialism once and for all, as we stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation. We therefore demand: That the British Government calls for an immediate ceasefire and protection of medical facilities, lifting the siege and ensuring unrestricted humanitarian access to save lives in Gaza. That the British Government withdraws all diplomatic, military, economic and material support to Israel as it commits crimes against the Palestinian people, and that it imposes sanctions and a two-way arms embargo on Israel. That the British Government takes active steps to promote the rights of Palestinians to freedom, self-determination and return, as enshrined in international law. To bring these demands about, we call on: Civil society to unite in a focused campaign to end the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, and to end British state support for Israeli crimes. Trade unions and workers to heed the call by Palestinian trade unionists to stop and hinder the trade of arms with Israel and take concrete action against arms companies and other companies involved in implementing Israel’s brutal and illegal siege. Black, brown and migrant-led organisations and communities in Britain to unite in a campaign for anti-colonial justice, and create shared demands for apologies, reparations and an end to British imperialism overseas, and criminalisation at home. We confront this moment of great threat and grief together with courage, hope and the determination to act since the histories of our communities have taught us that out of great darkness can emerge a renewed commitment to freedom, to justice and to human dignity.

Migrants Organise,The Justice for Omisha Campaign – Get Involved!,25-Oct-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/the-justice-for-omisha-campaign-get-involved/,"This blog was written by Reeja Shrestha , who is campaigning for justice after her daughter Omisha was charged £76,000 for her cancer treatment. I am expressing my gratitude to all the supporters who have signed the Justice for Omisha petition , and made it to this level. I saw immense support from people who realised what the Hostile Environment is and how it has affected migrants and refugees. Thank you for raising your voice against the injustice and becoming the voice of the voiceless. My daughter Omisha was diagnosed with Liver Cancer when she was 10 months old and as a result, she had a Liver Transplant when she was just a year old. This all happened when we, as a parents of Omisha, had no visa and no status. During that time, we were not allowed to do all those basic things that normal people do in their day-to-day lives. We had zero income and zero savings – the only things we had were bank credits, loans, one single rented room, and household expenses which resulted in depression and anxiety. We were sad, angry, helpless, and depressed — and even though we while explained our financial situation to the hospital, they continued to send us the bills. The response was always very rigid, cold, and had lack of empathy, which made us feel like we were the ones who were wrong. With Migrants Organise and the #PatientsNotPassports campaign, we fought with the overseas team of the hospital, and against the injustice system of NHS. We have participated in various events, leafleted in our local community, and I have spoken out to share my story with others. We started a petition for Omisha to cancel her NHS debt and saw many people supporting us. Then I knew that we were not wrong the whole time. With all the support from so many people, I have managed to uplift my confidence to talk more about our campaign and the fight against the Hostile Environment. I wrote to my local MP to discuss more about the debt, and with Migrants Organise and the Patients Not Passports campaign, we met him in person to put forward our demands. Our MP – Mr. Wes Streeting – helped us by writing to the CEO of the hospital. In response, the CEO of the hospital wrote us an apology letter and told us that the NHS charge of the family has been withdrawn and won’t be pursued now or in the future. This was a big win — but our campaign has not ended . The debt in our immigration history is still recorded in the Home Office file and it will affect our next visa process or will be questioned whenever we travel. Our MP also wrote to the Immigration Minister a few months ago, but sadly he said it cannot be canceled. The debt did cause a problem when I traveled last month with my older daughter, Shreeya. I was stopped at the Heathrow airport due to the debt recorded in the immigration history, and I was asked a question about it. I was told to show if there is any proof that I do not owe the debt to the hospital anymore. Thanks to the Migrants Organise team I had a letter and this helped me to convince the Border Agents that the hospital is not pursuing me for the debt. However, I was stopped, questioned and made to wait due to the debt recorded in my immigration history. The letter from the immigration minister where he mentioned about not causing any trouble while travelling was proved to be wrong. And so I am still involved and continue to take the Justice for Omisha campaign forward because this is how migrants are treated by the Home Office on a daily basis. I felt like a criminal who is being detained by the police officer – just because my daughter got sick. No one should feel like this and made to feel like you have done something wrong when you are a victim yourself, a victim of a hostile environment . I am and will still fight against this injustice and that no other migrants has to feel like what I have felt. Our campaign is still going strong and it will continue to grow until all the migrants and refugees will be treated the same and given equal rights and opportunities like any other human being. Therefore, our fight against the unjust system of border controls in the NHS is still going strong, and it will continue until everyone gets justice. We will continue to campaign until the end of the Hostile Environment for Migrants and refugees from its roots. I hope you will do your best to support the cause of the migrants and refugees who want justice. SIGN OMISHA’S PETITION HERE: https://change.org/justiceforomisha"
Migrants Organise,Solidarity Knows No Borders National Summit 2023,10-Oct-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/solidarity-knows-no-borders-national-summit-2023/,"Solidarity Knows No Borders (SKNB) is a community of migrant organisations, groups and individuals, working in solidarity, to end hostility and racism against migrants and refugees. Together we are demanding dignity and justice for all. On Friday 29th and Saturday 30th of September 2023, over 120 organisers came together – from  across campaigns, groups, collectives and organisations-  in London to build and nourish our movement of resistance and care,  to connect our struggles and campaigns, and to imagine the world we want to win together. The Solidarity Knows No Borders (SKNB) 2023 National Summit was a powerful collective space to be together in community and build towards a shared vision of liberation and migrant justice. Solidarity Knows No Borders is more than a call to action—it’s a shared commitment. A commitment to working together at the grassroots to meet the needs of our neighbours and a commitment to coming together to imagine better futures for all. This year, the Summit was carefully put together by the ‘ SKNB Planning Committee’ – made up of  SKNB community members including Women Seeking Asylum Together Manchester, Migrants in Culture, Hastings Refugee Buddy Project, Migrants Organise and others. The strength of Solidarity Knows No Borders is that it acknowledges that we are stronger united. The movement gathers together a wide range of organisers working on different issues – from organising to end the hostile environment in public services to demanding dignity in housing-  and connects them into a broader struggle and collective principles.  It was important that this was reflected in the planning process of the Summit. Since the last National Summit in 2021, we have faced huge challenges – two new hostile acts of parliament and an unrelenting corporate and state machine criminalising us by all means at their disposal. We have also witnessed the rise of new right-wing media channels that seek to dehumanise us. But, as a community,  we have come together to fight this hostile environment at every step of the way. We have stood united against Rwanda deportation flights, against fascist attacks on accommodations for people seeking protection, and against NHS charging. Our resilience and people power have grown and together we have created new communities of care. It was against this backdrop that we collectively decided that the 2023 National Summit would be markedly different to the summits of previous years – where action planning took priority- and would give priority to organisers being together in the same space in order to build and strengthen organising relationships that will sustain us for the long road towards the world we want to win. After all, our people are our power. The Summit of 2023 was all about: Building, Sustaining and Growing the SKNB Community of Care and Resistance Over the course of the two days, there was lots of time for radical listening and connecting over coffee, tea and nourishing food. This included time for intentional one-to-one organising conversations, for walks together, for dancing, time for joy and time for quietness. Sharing Knowledge, Resources and Mapping the Network A focus on decentralised collective learning through breakout sessions delivered by members of the SKNB community and beyond. Our sessions focused on: How to Resist An Immigration Raid (learning ways to protect our communities with West London Resistance Collective); Workplace Rights (with Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, IWGB) ; Nothing About us Without Us (exploring how campaigns around individual can bring together a collective movement for justice with the Justice for Omisha campaign, Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, South London Refugee Association, Patients Not Passports and Medact); Mapping Community Infrastructures of care (with Helen Brewer); Media and the Hostile Environment (building a media toolkit together with with Migrants Organise); Climate Justice is Migrant Justice (exploring the intersections between climate and migrant justice with the Climate Justice Coalition, No Borders in Climate Justice, Tipping Point and War on Want); Science Fiction Writing (unleashing our imagination to visualise a better world with Migrants in Culture, Saturday School);  and Embodied Leadership (a new approach to leadership with Healing Justice London). There was also the chance for people organising around similar issues to connect and learn from each other using a visual mapping created by Migrants in Culture. We also mapped our shared history and created a timeline of SKNB together! This gave us an opportunity to reflect upon the shared history of the movement and have older and newer members of the community to visualise their work and role in building the movement. Importantly it prompted us to look to the future and ask how do we grow the movement. As we say in SKNB: each one bring one. Solidarity Knows No Borders shared timeline Imagining, Dreaming, Planning & Action We also made the time and space to dream of the world we want to win. To collectivise and discuss how we build and sustain alternative ecosystems and communities that thrive and take care of each other. We have the solutions and resources within our communities. Visual notetaking, photography and film-making were all a crucial part of the Solidarity Knows No Borders National Summit – capturing moments and visualising the movement for migrant justice. After two days with this beautiful community of organisers and resistors, the Migrants Organise team left feeling nourished, hopeful and steadfast in the belief that our strength comes from decentralisation and acting in solidarity with each other.

Migrants Organise,Legal Briefing—Legal Challenge Against the Bibby Stockholm Barge,09-Oct-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/bibbybargeupdate/,"The Home Office has confirmed to Migrants Organise that it is now committed  to providing 7 days notice to individuals before moving them on to the Bibby Stockholm Barge. This provides people a clearer time frame to prepare for the move and to challenge. The confirmation was given to Migrants Organise via pre-action protocol correspondence. Our overall position remains unchanged: the barge will never be a safe or suitable accommodation for migrants or people seeking asylum. No amount of repurposing can make it so. Read the briefing in full. Our Legal Organiser, Brian Dikoff states. “We need appropriate, compassionate and safe infrastructure to support new people and welcome them into our communities. We need communities not cages. This is why we organise for dignity and justice for migrants and refugees.” Read on for more information. Full briefing. At the end of July 2023,  the Home Office started issuing very short notices to individual who were going to be moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge. This left highly vulnerable people without the adequate information and representation. Over the next 2 weeks, individuals were regularly given notices in late afternoon for a move early on the next day (or Monday morning), which did not allow them any opportunity to provide any reasons or representations if they did not believe that the Bibby Stockholm barge is a suitable accommodation for them. In the run up to this period, Migrants Organise had been carrying our pre-litigation work against the Barge with support from the Strategic Legal Fund and with the tireless work of colleagues at Wilsons Solicitors and the counsel team at Garden Court Chambers. We also travelled down to Portland, Dorset to deliver outreach advice and casework to many of the individuals who had been moved to the barge. As a result, many individuals were able to obtain advice and, when they wished to, challenge the notice and/or move to the barge. We also organised and sent a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office on August 6th 2023, followed by a supplementary letter on 18 September 2023. On 21st September 2023 the Home Office responded to us  – confirming that the Home Office will provide a minimum of 7 days to individuals before being moved onto the barge. This was only achievable through organised work by so many different individuals, groups and organisations. We are not alone in this work, we part of a much wider community and movement of people and organisations standing up for dignity and justice. Through Legal organising we built our knowledge and power through connecting with  Care4Calais, Portland Global Friendship, Doctors of the World, the Helen Bamber Foundation, other front-line charities, as well as many public law firms including Wilson Solicitors, Deighton Pierce Glynn (DPG), Public Law Project (PLP), Gold Jennings, Duncan Lewis, Simpson Millar, Lawstop and others, to triage and signpost cases. We need your solidarity to build a broad based movement for justice. The government’s  anti migrant Hostile Environment continues to harm lives and communities. In this context, there are no small victories and every act of solidarity is valued. Here are a few ways to show solidarity: Portland’s mayor, Ms Carralyn Parks represented by Deighton Pierce Glynn is also challenging the use of the Bibby Stockholm barge. A permission hearing is scheduled for 10 October 2023. You can show support on social media. If you are in Liverpool Actions Against Detention and Deportation is organising an action on Monday 9 October 2023. Follow Migrants Organise on social media and join our newsletter updates.

Migrants Organise,Connecting Climate Justice & Migrant Justice: A Guide to Countering Dangerous Narratives – Report Launch!,20-Sep-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/connecting-climate-justice-migrant-justice-a-guide-to-countering-dangerous-narratives-report-launch/,"In a world where the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent, the discourse around climate-linked migration is reaching a critical point. Recent narratives, filled with sweeping projections and dangerous undertones, threaten to shape policy responses that lack empathy, compassion and human regard. It’s time we steer this conversation towards a path of solidarity, shared humanity, and justice. That is why we are excited to share with you our latest brief , ‘Connecting Climate Justice & Migrant Justice: A Guide to Countering Dangerous Narratives’ , which we are launching today alongside 350.org, the Climate and Migration Coalition, the Climate Justice Coalition, the Climate Justice Collaborative NPNA, Common Defense, Friends of the Earth US, International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change. Key highlights of the brief include: An in-depth analysis of current narratives: Understand how the current focus on projected numbers, and the use of dehumanising narratives, are shaping policy responses. Naming the real villains: Learn about profiteers benefiting from the climate crisis and violent borders,  and how we can shift the focus onto them, fostering a more just and open approach. A vision for the future: Discover the principles for framing climate and migration, which focus on the right to stay and the right to move, and how they represent real security for communities globally. It unravels the complex narratives surrounding climate-linked migration. We have the responsibility to craft a narrative that respects the rights of individuals both to remain and to migrate safely and with dignity. Share the report on Instagram here , or Twitter/X here . As climate change reshapes global migration patterns, we must emphasise equity and human rights in our approach to climate-linked migration. It is crucial to foster collaboration among movements, media, academics, trade unions, and many more organisations to ensure the dignity and safety of migrants globally. Dangerous narratives, which often use fear-based language, threaten to undermine this mission by dehumanising migrants and delaying effective climate action. These narratives mask the true complexity of migration and often place undue burden on vulnerable communities. Together, we can counter these narratives through justice-based framing that fosters solidarity, advocates human rights, and propels intersectional climate action. We are happy to share the guide here to help climate and migrant justice advocates, journalists and policy makers speak about the intersections of climate change and migration. Addressing the communication gap Central to the communication challenge is the focus on widely varied estimates of future numbers of people who MAY be forced to flee climate disasters. These large numbers are based on speculation, undermine the right of people to climate adaptation funding and their right to stay in their homes, and serve a dehumanising narrative.  The unpredictability of climate disasters and the differing opinions among experts on the best method for data collection make it difficult to accurately project migration trends. This uncertainty fuels polarised debates, often accompanied by the dehumanising portrayal of migrants in headlines and on social media platforms. Inaccurate or exaggerated data can promote dangerous narratives and increase anti-migrant sentiments in communities. While the majority of climate-related migration happens within nations, cross-border movements also occur. It is essential for communicators to bear in mind that migration is a form of adaptation and that both internal and external movement are key strategies for humane policies in the face of climate disaster and displacement. It’s vital to show solidarity with all affected by climate-related adversities, fostering a ground for fair policy-making that embodies global unity. Notably, despite its frequent use, the term “climate refugee” isn’t legally recognised. This raises a serious issue: the lack of formal avenues and specific legal frameworks for the support of those forced to move due to climate impacts. The terminology can oversimplify the multifaceted reasons behind individual migration stories, possibly overshadowing the complex conditions driving individuals to relocate. Despite this, some climate migrants might meet the criteria for refugee or asylum status due to other factors influencing their displacement. Hence, precise terminology is essential. Principles for framing climate and migration In steering the discourse towards a more humane and compassionate ground, we should promote values that emphasise the innate connection between individuals affected by climate change and their receiving communities. By invoking shared values and highlighting the global nature of climate change, we can foster a narrative that strikes a chord with audiences at a deeper, more empathic level. Additionally, it is vital to identify and expose those benefiting from the exploitation and ill-treatment of migrants. These range from corporations profiting from border and surveillance industries to fossil fuel enterprises delaying the just transition to cleaner energy sources. By naming these “villains”, the narrative shifts focus onto the real threats, paving the way for the needed policy reforms. Moreover, the principles of “right to stay” and “right to move ” form the cornerstone of a just and visionary approach to climate-linked migration. Advocating for funded climate adaptations and the facilitation of safe, dignified migrations can potentially redefine security for communities worldwide, offering a glimmer of hope and tangible solutions in a rapidly changing environment. Embracing these principles moves us closer to fostering a narrative that not only recognises the gravity of climate-linked migration but also propels action towards a more inclusive, empathetic, and secure future for all. For more details, please refer to our briefing, ‘Connecting Climate Justice & Migrant Justice: A Guide to Countering Dangerous Narratives’."

ABOUT MIGRANTS ORGANISE Migrants Organise is a grassroots community organising platform for dignity and justice. The organisation was founded 30 years ago by migrants and refugees who needed advice and support to settle in London. Working nationally, it is still led by people whose lives are defined, controlled, and adversely affected by immigration controls. As a result, the Migrants Organise approach has always been a holistic combination of direct advice and support services and organising for systemic change. We understand migrant justice organising both as a vision and practice of power and solidarity."
Migrants Organise,Press Release: Migrants Organise takes action against Home Office over unsafe Bibby Stockholm prison barge,07-Aug-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/press-release-migrants-organise-takes-action-against-home-office-over-unsafe-bibby-stockholm-prison-barge/,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Migrants Organise is seeking to raise a legal challenge against the Home Office’s use of the Bibby Stockholm barge as asylum support accommodation Despite serious risks raised by Migrants Organise and others, the Home Office has insisted on moving individuals onto the Bibby Stockholm barge today “The Bibby Stockholm is not safe and no amount of repurposing can make it so. It will never be an appropriate place to put people who are seeking safety, here to rebuild their lives. We need appropriate, compassionate and safe infrastructure to support individuals and welcome them into our communities.” AUGUST 7 — Ahead of today’s move of people seeking asylum onto the Bibby Stockholm barge by the Home Office, migrant rights charity Migrants Organise, represented by Wilson Solicitors and barristers at Garden Court Chambers, sent a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office challenging the use of the Bibby Stockholm as accommodation for people seeking asylum. The letter, sent on August 6th to the Home Office’s lawyers, asks that the Home Office stops the move of all individuals onto the Bibby Stockholm until and unless all concerns regarding the safety and suitability of the barge have been adequately addressed, including the necessary fire safety checks. The letter also asks for a suitable and effective screening process to be put in place and for individuals to be provided at least 72 hours’ notice, including at least one working day, of a move on board. Migrants Organise claims that the Bibby Stockholm is not suitable accommodation for people seeking asylum, and that the Home Office’s plans raise serious risks. Contrary to the Home Office’s own published policy, Migrants Organise is aware of disabled people, victims of torture and people with severe mental health issues, as well as those with phobias of water being given notice to move to the Bibby Stockholm. In their previous correspondence with the Home Office on July 24th and 31st, Migrants Organise had raised several strong concerns regarding conditions on board including unlawful detention of individuals, overcrowding, risk from far right groups, and lack of privacy. They also highlighted to the Home Office that HMP Weare, a prison ship akin to the Bibby Stockholm, housed in Portland Port from 1997 to 2005, was notably evacuated on an urgent basis due to unacceptable fire risk when its sprinkler system was found to be faulty after the prison service moved prisoners on board against the advice of local fire chiefs [1]. HMP Weare eventually closed down due to “unacceptably cramped and claustrophobic conditions” and due to it being “unsuitable, expensive and in the wrong place” and “entirely unsuitable for its present function” [2]. A recent Freedom of Information Request from NHS Dorset reveals that a draft outbreak management plan warns of the impact of an outbreak on the barge [3]. Last week, the Fire Brigade Union also wrote to the Home Secretary to raise concerns about the fire safety of the barge [4]. Despite these concerns raised by Migrants Organise and others, the Home Office has insisted on moving people into the barge today. Individuals were given notices late on Friday evening for a move early the following Monday, significantly limiting their ability to obtain independent legal advice, as is their right. Migrants Organise is particularly concerned about individuals who cannot obtain legal support and so are effectively forced to move to accommodation that is wholly inadequate for them and dangerous. Brian Dikoff, Legal Organiser at Migrants Organise said: “The Bibby Stockholm barge is designed to be unwelcoming, controversial and act as a very visible form of punishment and deterrence. We had very serious concerns about safety on board and that the Home Office would not properly screen or safeguard individuals planned to be moved to the barge, and we are now seeing these concerns becoming reality. The Bibby Stockholm is not safe and no amount of repurposing can make it so. It will never be an appropriate place to put people who are seeking safety, here to rebuild their lives. We need appropriate, compassionate and safe infrastructure to support individuals and welcome them into our communities.” NOTES FOR EDITORS [1] “Fire-risk prison ship abandoned.” Ian Burrell.

Migrants Organise,Bibby Stockholm will never be safe. This is why we’re taking action.,04-Aug-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/bibby-stockholm-will-never-be-safe-this-is-why-were-taking-action/,"This Government’s plan to “house” people on the Bibby Stockholm will never be safe. This is why we oppose it, and this is what we’re doing about it. The Bibby Stockholm will never be safe. People who are here to seek safety are not pawns to be moved, detained, or imprisoned with every political whim. They are human beings deserving of safety, dignity, and a place to call home. Barges like the Bibby Stockholm as well as ex-military barracks, de facto detention hotels are not, and never will be safe homes. We need appropriate, compassionate and safe infrastructure to support new neighbours and welcome them into our communities. We need communities not cages. This is why we have been taking action. A floating prison Everyone deserves a decent home to make a life. But the Bibby Stockholm – based on Portland Port- is a precarious and unsustainable stopgap that will only cause further harm for people trying to settle in a new place. Surrounded by a large, looming fence and barbed wire coupled with 24 hour patrolling security the barge is designed to make like miserable for vulnerable people. It’s designed to be unwelcoming, controversial and act as a very visible form of punishment. It is designed as a floating prison. We are especially concerned that people forced to stay on the barge are not going to be able to move freely, and in effect will be detained. We are also aware of a number of vulnerable people, with serious mental health conditions like Post Traumatic Stress Disorders being threatened to be detained on Bibby Stockholm. From our extensive experience with the asylum support system we know there are serious deficiencies with the Home Office’s safeguarding procedures. The lack of fire checks is one clear example of how this Government has been comfortable with cutting corners at the expense of vulnerable people. The billions of pounds they spend harming us could help build decent community housing and local services and in turn build better futures — instead it’s funnelled to private corporations for prison barges, hotel contracts, military barracks, detention centres and to make life as miserable as possible. Taking action We know there is a different approach and that there is huge support for an approach of welcome, compassion and solidarity. Safe community housing is the best solution for people who move here and our communities. Within communities, people are able to lay roots, find support systems and start to rebuild their lives. A commitment to ‘welcome’ means holding this government, the home office, and its private contractors, accountable. Welcome means taking action. That’s why we are connected with local organisers, organisations and councillors in Portland who are taking action in solidarity with migrants and refugees. Together alongside Wilson’s LLP and other charities and public law firms we are are committed to making sure that every individual that is threatened with de-facto detention on board Bibby has access to legal justice. Together, we are building power to fight this government’s anti-refugee laws and its broader hostile anti-migrant agenda. We do this while also caring for our communities. This work could not be done without you and your solidarity. Read more about this work in The Independent and The Guardian .

Migrants Organise,Unions & Migrant Organisations’ statement – public sector pay rise,19-Jul-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/unions-migrant-organisations-statement-public-sector-pay-rise/,"Unions unite with migrant organisations to call out government plan to fund pay rise with higher migrant fees. Major trade unions – including the BMA, NEU, NASUWT, GMB and PCS – have come together with over 50 migrant organisations, to call out the government’s plan to fund a public sector pay rise through higher NHS and visa fees for migrants. Our NHS – Stop Charging Migrants demonstration Joint Statement As trade unions and migrant organisations, we stand against this Government’s attempts to pit worker against worker . We know that an injury to one is an injury to all. All workers deserve decent pay, safe working conditions and protections if our bosses seek to take advantage of us. Public sector workers deserve pay rises, but we strongly oppose any decision to fund this by further taxing migrants , by hiking visa costs and NHS fees. This is a blatant attempt to sow division within the labour movement and our communities. Increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge by 66% and increasing visa costs will push ever more people into destitution and poverty . The UK already effectively taxes migrants twice for healthcare, and has some of the most extortionate visa fees in Europe – a migrant family of four often has to pay around £50,000 over 10 years for the right to stay. This massive increase is simply unaffordable – it will price workers out of being able to afford a visa and force thousands further into poverty during the cost of living crisis, or out of the country. Migrant workers are a vital part of our communities and our workforce. They are the backbone of our public services, and our migrant members already face the hostility of the immigration system. No worker should be pushed into poverty, unsustainable debt or homelessness simply because of the papers they hold. We urge the Government to abandon its plans to increase NHS and visa fees for migrants and meet the pay demands of our public sector workers through progressive taxation which ensures those with the broadest shoulders contribute more to our vital public services.

Migrants Organise,"They are people, not boats: Speaking out against the Refugee Ban",19-Jul-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/people-not-boats/,"Another hostile and cruel immigration bill has been passed into law in the House of Commons. It sounds surreal to write this sentence again in July 2023;  the last piece of legislation, the Nationality and Borders Act came into force on 28 June 2022, and the one before that (Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act) just in 2020. It would be hard to keep track of all the laws and hostile policies if the reality of them is not so painfully visible in the daily lives of thousands of people we see and organise with at Migrants Organise. This country is in a  perpetual cycle of violent immigration legislation, and the way it has been conducted speaks volumes about everything that is wrong with our democracy. The reality of immigration as a normal human phenomenon and international protection as a part of our legal  and moral responsibility has been completely erased from the conversation. A lot has happened since the last bill. The war in Sudan broke out, generating another humanitarian emergency. We’ve had three Prime Ministers, countless Ministers, and MPs accompanied by countless scandals and a crushed economy . Image by Migrants Organise outside Parliament at a demo agains the Refugee Ban Bill. March 2023. Despite so many failures to address many urgent issues facing our country (or even recover essential WhatsApp messages needed for the Covid Inquiry) this government, still reeling from the Rwanda Plan defeat, prioritised the Illegal Immigration Bill most efficiently. When the bill returned from the House of Lords back to the House of Commons, this government pushed 18 votes in under four hours, overturning all Lord’s amendments. This sets a dangerous precedent. Imagine what else can be pushed through the Commons in 18 votes under 4 hours, with complete disregard for the Lords? Some ministers’ unprecedented attention to detail included painting over children’s cartoon characters in a ‘reception’ facility – the mural was feared to give too much of a “welcoming message”. No episode of The Thick of It, Yes Minister, or even Monty Python would come even close to this level of the surreal. The bill is so egregious that it provoked the first-ever rebellion from the former PM Theresa “Hostile Environment” May and another 15 Conservative MPs. Some concessions have been made concerning the detention of pregnant women and unaccompanied children, which is meant to keep some backbenchers quiet. These concessions are tinkering around the edges of a terrible policy. They will not do much to justify the most illiberal piece of legislation, which is by the admission of the Home Secretary in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It’s important to note that the ECHR has nothing to do with the EU or Brexit. It was drafted in the aftermath of WW2 and the Holocaust to protect the people from the State and ensure the atrocities committed would never be repeated. This is in addition to The 1951 Geneva Convention , signed and ratified by the UK, which provides further and specific guarantees to people in need of protection. The Convention provides an internationally agreed legal framework which defined legal routes to protection and which the UK government has been trying to limit for decades. The Illegal Immigration Bill – or to name it what it is, The Refugee Ban Bill- will effectively end refugee protection as defined by the 1951 Convention. It makes it ‘legal’ for the UK not to consider applications of people based on the mode of entry. As there are no regular ways to enter the UK and apply for asylum, all people seeking asylum who entered through irregular routes – something that is provided for by the 1951 Convention – will be detained and deported. This includes children, pregnant women, victims of trafficking, and people fleeing Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan or Syria. While waiting to be removed, vulnerable and traumatised people will be detained in military bases and barges. Huge contracts have been handed to profit-making enforcement companies to do this dishonourable and inhumane job. A magic money tree has appeared again to pay billions to inflict misery and injustice . Like with the so-called ‘Rwanda Plan’, many provisions of the Illegal Immigration Act will be challenged in courts and probably found unlawful. This will take a long time, and many people will be stuck in limbo. Legal advice is difficult to obtain, and the process takes a long time. The government will attack the judiciary and legal profession for doing their job. The right-wing media will come after advocates and human rights campaigners, which will embolden growing far-right populists prepared to act on their hate online a nd in places where refugees are detained . We, the imaginary voters,  are supposed to forget the mishandling of the pandemic, the PPE contracts dished out to friends and relatives, and the parties that went on in government offices while we obeyed the instructions and grieved for our loved ones in isolation. We are supposed to forget the fall of Kabul and the promises made to Afghans we left behind. We are expected to forget the rising queues at food banks and the school meals secured by footballers . We are supposed to ignore the medication shortages and the loss of our freedom of movement in the EU, to mention just a few side effects of getting ‘Brexit done’! We are supposed to forget the rise in our bills, rents and mortgages, the pollution of our rivers, and the abysmal failure of the privatised for-profit water companies . All of the above, and much more, is supposed to be erased from our memory on the next election day, and we would vote for the government prepared to detain pregnant women and children, paint over Mickey Mouse posters on the wall to make children unwelcome and send them off to Rwanda. One cannot help but ask what sort of people, including politicians, would think this is a winning strategy for anything. In the sea of other news, almost unnoticed by the UK’s mainstream media, is an announcement that the longest-serving Dutch PM Mark Rutte is quitting politics after his coalition government collapsed on Friday, July 7, after the ruling parties disagreed on a new asylum policy. For months, Dutch ministers have discussed new measures to limit the number of people seeking protection. But two coalition parties refused Rutte’s proposal to make it harder for refugee families to reunite. Rutte has led the Netherlands since October 2010 in four different coalitions, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history. The carrier-ending move for him was an attempt to limit family reunion for refugees. Is there a lesson here for Rishi “Stop the Boats” Sunak? Or Suella “Rwanda Dreams” Braverman? Or perhaps Robert “Mickey Mouse” Jenrick? Sadly, no. This government is in their Hostile Environment policy bubble, which is all about brutal enforcement, regardless of the human, reputational and financial costs.  Refugees are not people to them – they are faceless statistics, numbers and boats, and they think this is the vote winner. But there is a lesson here for the opposition and the rest of us. We must stand in solidarity with refugees and migrants and maintain our convictions, our resilience and our hope. Despite the hostile rhetoric and policies, plenty of research and polling shows that British public attitudes about immigration are increasingly positive. Progressive opposition must show leadership, devise an alternative approach, and shift the narrative away from enforcement and hostility. We all must create space for solidarity and defeat attempts to divide us. The hostility, dehumanisation, gaslighting and criminalisation of people on the move must never be accepted and normalised. They are people, NOT boats! Reach out to your community at work or in your neighbourhood,  your trade union, your faith group, your school or university, reach out to many campaigning groups, charities and organisations  – and organise. The government’s cruelty is designed to silence and isolate us – but we won’t let it. Now is the time to organise together for dignity, justice and welcome. As Mandela said, “It always seems impossible until it is done!” So don’t be a bystander. Organise! The Solidarity Knows No Borders community has been doing just that- organising from the grassroots for a better future, for dignity and justice for all. Solidarity Knows No Borders (SKNB) is a community of migrant organisations, groups and individuals, working in solidarity, to end hostility and racism against migrants and refugees. Together we are demanding dignity and justice for all."
Migrants Organise,Report Launch: Housing In A Hostile Environment,18-Jul-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/report-launch-housing-in-a-hostile-environment/,"Migrants Organise has contributed to a new report from Generation Rent, Housing In A Hostile Environment, which exposes a racist housing market. The findings , from a survey conducted with 126 migrant private renters, highlights the obstacles and experiences facing people on the sharp end of racist hostile environment policies in accessing housing. 42% reported that they had struggled to find a landlord or letting agent to rent to them as a migrant. 74% of migrant private renters had struggled to find somewhere affordable to rent. 30% had been threatened with an eviction. 57% reported that they had experienced mould or damp. Of those that had reported their most recent incident of disrepair to their landlord or letting agent, 51% stated that their landlord had not fixed the repair issue. Migrants Organise members contributed to this report by sharing their experiences of living in temporary and private rented accommodation where many are consistently forced to live in undignified conditions. Peter*, recalled: “[The] landlord tried repeatedly to illegally evict with violence to force entry, once with the help of the police who smashed the door in and demanded to see ID in the hopes it would lead to an eviction without court.” Everyone deserves the right to live in safe and dignified housing, but this government’s hostile immigration system continues to put people at risk of exploitation even in their own homes. Members that contributed to the research often stated that poor treatment and a lack of rights whilst living in temporary accommodation acted as significant barriers in accessing safe and secure housing in the Private Rented Sector. Emiliano*, said: “Instead of being happy when you get granted [settled status], you may then just find yourself in trouble. Because they stopped giving you whatever they used to give before… And then, how are you supposed to start fresh? Because if you’re going to rent, you have to pay [a] deposit, you have to pay [the] first month of rent, or probably like three months in advance, because they want to make sure that you can afford that without no work experience. With no income, with no bank account, because you’re not allowed to have a bank account. How are you going to handle that?” Migrants Organise Housing Action Group are organising for a world without border controls in housing. People should be able to live in safe, decent homes in their communities and this requires a universal housing standard for all. Ben Twomey, Chief Executive of Generation Rent, said: “Migrant renters are subjected to an exhausting, unsafe and heartless system, where they are disproportionately forced to bear the brunt of the worst of the housing sector. “The upcoming Renters (Reform) Bill must work to support all renters into safe and secure housing, including marginalised groups such as migrant communities. Only by listening to migrant renters and understanding their experience, will the government be able to get serious about ending housing discrimination in the UK.” By making the PRS and temporary accommodation fair for the most marginalised and discriminated groups in the UK, we make them fair for everyone.

Migrants Organise,Resilience Festival: “This is how we build hope”,13-Jul-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/memberspeaksout/,"This is a member blog by  I.K, as part of the Resilience Festival . I.K joined Migrants Organise in 2019 and has recently been supporting or members on a work placement with our Community Programme. “Resilience is about asking for help. I used to think that resilience meant being ‘strong’. But I realised that there are some things you can’t do alone. We have to help each other and connect with each other, this is how we give each other strength. When you are living your life in the asylum system, you realise there are things that are not in your control. You think to yourself “Oh the Home Office, they are more powerful than me”. It can lead to you feeling depressed. I have met people who have become very depressed. Of course in many ways the Home Office is more powerful than you. They have your life in their hands. They don’t care about your wellbeing or your future.  They don’t care about who you are. “We shall overcome”- I.K chose the image of a flower to represent resilience My journey has not been easy or straightforward I arrived in this country in 2018. It was a challenging journey, and has taken five years  for me to get refugee status. In this time, I have spent a short period in detention, then in a hotel and then living in different parts of London in NASS accommodation. I was also living with grief because I had lost family members back home. There are times when I couldn’t sleep, when I was having nightmares. It was hard. You see, your life is on hold. I experienced depression. I felt hopeless. In these moments, you have to find the right people to help you. This is how we build hope and connection to each other. When you find the people with the right knowledge and experience it can put you on the right path, you can build the right tools to be resilient. I first came to  Migrants Organise  in 2019. First I was helped with getting Legal Aid so that I had good representation. They matched me with a volunteer mentor who helped me apply for a little bit of money some grants so that was a big support. I started activities and meeting people. As a person who has applied for asylum, you are not allowed to work, and  you have very little money and support like this. I developed strategies like going to the food bank, going to local charities who could help. I began studying too at college. When the Home Office moved me across town, it started taking me over two hours to get to my English classes. The staff at Migrants Organise helped me with getting accommodation and support with travel expenses for that. It was important for me to keep going- studying helped me stay focused. It helped me stay in control. Mental Health is so important I realised that I was interested in mental health. It was something I’d experienced and seen in people who were in a similar situation to me. That’s why I began training as a nurse specialising in mental health. I am doing the same training as a general nurse but I am specialising in supporting people with conditions like depression, anxiety and other conditions. I have also supported people living in asylum accommodation in hotels. These conditions are very difficult- people have no choices. You cannot live freely, you always feel scared. There are many restrictions. For people who don’t understand English there are language barriers.  There are no activities inside, or space to go. Everything – like the cooking- is done on your behalf so you lose control….the only thing you can do is go to the park. People don’t like the food, it is always the same and the rice is not cooked very well. People are struggling. I think people should have the right to work. We shouldn’t be in this situation for this long. We want to have meaning, to connect with people and each other. These days I have been doing a work placement at Migrants Organise.  I am supporting people who are still waiting for an outcome on their asylum application. They know me well so it’s easy for them to talk to me and share their thoughts. I am interested in how the asylum process impacts our mental health. I’ve been learning a lot and supporting group activities, English classes, helping people learn English and get familiar with the London travel map and  supporting people at appointments. I’ve been feeling happy because you begin to understand how to help people get over something really big. I’ve been there. Don’t wait for the Home Office My message to anyone that is going through the asylum system: try to find an activity. The Home Office don’t care about your wellbeing, they don’t care about your future. So what you can do is connect with an organisation, a charity, like Migrants Organise to help you to overcome and build. This is a different country, a different culture, maybe you don’t understand the language- you need to spend the time learning English. You need to have a focus, something to hold on to. My advice is: don’t wait for the Home Office. As your case is proceeding, you can get involved with community activity, through that you will get connections. These connections with people will keep you going. No matter your resilience, you need help from others, we need each other.

Migrants Organise,Migrants Organise Members Are Telling Clearsprings: We Demand Decent Homes!,20-Jun-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/migrants-organise-members-are-telling-clearsprings-we-demand-decent-homes/,"Migrants Organise members are speaking up to demand decent homes from private provider Clearsprings Ready Homes. Please take action in solidarity with them by sharing this letter of their demands: To the Directors of Clearsprings Ltd, I am writing to express my concerns about conditions in ‘asylum accommodation’ provided and managed by your company under contract with the Home Office. I want to be sure that you are aware of these urgent issues I have been made aware of by a number of people in your care. These are their words: “… [I was] not allowed to spend 24 hour outside, no good food, no fridge, no microwave… [it]is like I have been living my life in prison.” “Home Office’s accommodation is horrible. It’s not up to standard, with broken facilities, no kettle, no hot water, no thick blanket, no TV, no electricity, broken windows, doors, glasses and mirror, and there are bed bugs, cockroaches, mice, spiders and flies. Where my friend live, there are 8 people and only one pan. Asylum seekers living in the Home Office’s accommodation can be for a very long time, months or years, with different people coming and going every couple of months, and it can be very bad for mental health. They’re trying to make our lives miserable and sorrowful.” (1) The poor state of accommodation was reported by various news media outlets . There have also been numerous complaints made to Migrant Help about the conditions in Clearsprings managed accommodation – in October 2022 – 348 complaints were made . Despite this evidence demonstrating that these poor living conditions are widespread and systemic, it appears to us that you have failed to address them. Many people told us that they feel afraid that speaking out will somehow negatively impact their asylum claims . Your company continues to amass huge profits while the conditions in ‘asylum accommodation’  do not seem to improve. In 2022, in the midst of a cost of living crisis, you reported £28m in net profits while your residents lived in decrepit houses and struggled to buy food and other essential items. It seems clear that even the basic standards outlined in the Asylum Accommodation and Support Schedule Statement of Requirements that accommodation is  ‘safe, secure and warm’ and requires ‘effective resolution of service user maintenance issues and complaints” are not being met. Reports of mould, overcrowding, inedible food, lack of access to the kitchen or microwave, running hot water, privacy, and no communal spaces are common. This is unacceptable and does not allow people to live in dignity. Clearsprings should publicly apologise for the distress caused to people who have resided and continue to reside in the accommodation contracted by the Home Office and commit to making improvements and treating people in your care with humanity and dignity. In solidarity with the Clearsprings residents and friends who are deliberately silenced and unheard, I would like a written response addressing what is being done to improve the conditions and prioritise the well-being and dignity of people living in Clearsprings asylum accommodation. We believe people should be housed in communities with dignity. If you believe this too you would drop the contract with the Home Office who are intent on enforcing a hostile environment for migrants.

Migrants Organise,Migrants Organise Resilience Festival 2023 gets started!,16-Jun-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/migrants-organise-resilience-festival-2023-gets-started/,"We’re delighted to launch the 2023 Resilience Festival at Migrants Organise. Read on for more information about the festival and why it’s so necessary. This year’s programme In 2023, the Resilience Festival runs from June 13th until July 15th  and coincides with Refugee Week. The festival includes: a 10km Walk across London, music, gardening, art, jewellery making, mindfulness, storytelling, fun days and picnics. These activities build on our weekly  group activities that continuously run as part of our Community Programme; from football, poetry, art and language groups to name a few. The joy of sharing space, activity food and music with our community is a reminder of the better world we are building together. Building Community After Lockdown “… by joining this group I am gaining my confidence back. That loneliness that I felt before is just gradually disappearing.” Migrants Organise Member. The idea for the “Resilience Festival” emerged in 2021. After the profound challenges and loss experienced during the pandemic, we wanted to create spaces of joy, friendship and resilience to help us process the trauma and grief we all felt. It was also at a time when we had to re-learn the process of coming together and being with each other, after months of isolation. We ran online and offline spaces and activities, ranging from mindfulness, music, art, dance, story-telling, creative writing and gardening.  It was immensely popular and in 2021 over 170 of our members participated and shared in this space of positivity and support. Building Solidarity Whilst we organise and campaign to change unjust systems, we need to be there for people currently subjected to our hostile immigration and asylum system. If you’d like to support the vital work we are doing with our members feel free to donate to our Legal Walk Fundraiser."
Migrants Organise,Talk TV Issues Apology and Pays Substantial Damages to Migrants Organise for Defamatory Statements,14-Jun-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/talk-tv-issues-apology-and-pays-substantial-damages-to-migrants-organise-for-defamatory-statements/,"Migrants Organise, an award-winning charity advocating for the rights and welfare of migrants and refugees, has received an apology and damages following defamatory accusations made by Talk TV and its host, Mr Mike Graham. Presenter Mr Mike Graham made false and damaging assertions on his show, The Independent Republic of Mike Graham, and in his Tweets in June 2022, which characterised Migrants Organise and its dedicated efforts to support migrants and refugees in inaccurate and harmful ways. The comments were broadcast on 10 June 2022 and repeatedly shared on Twitter until 13 June 2022, inspiring a torrent of hateful messages and threats against Migrants Organise and its charitable funders. Recognising the gravity of the defamatory statements and the potential harm they could cause to Migrants Organise’s reputation and work, the charity pursued legal recourse for a year to seek redress and vindication. After negotiations, Talk TV and Mr Graham agreed to publish an apology stating that they “ accept there wasn’t a factual basis” to allegations that Migrants Organise “facilitated fraud and terrorism”. In addition to the apology , News UK Broadcasting Ltd agreed to pay Migrants Organise legal costs and substantial damages . Migrants Organise CEO Zrinka Bralo said: “We are pleased to have resolved this matter and received an apology and damages for the false and damaging allegations. We sought to protect our reputation and the safety of our people – migrants and refugees, our volunteers, staff, allies and supporters who work for dignity and justice. We were exposed to hate and threats of violence as a result of the mischaracterisation of our work and the dehumanisation of people in need, and we had to take a stand.” The public apology and the settlement from Talk TV and Mr Graham highlight the importance of standing up for fair and truthful reporting. Charities supporting vulnerable people are increasingly targeted by inaccurate media coverage and inflammatory language. Migrants Organise CEO Zrinka Bralo added, “This victory is for the people behind these headlines, people who have no voice or representation, people who are scapegoated, demonised and dehumanised. Their resilience is the source of hope for all of us. The least we can do is to treat them with humanity, and instead of blaming them for all our problems, we should look for more ways to welcome them.” The damages received from the settlement will be utilised by Migrants Organise to further support our vital work in supporting migrants and refugees to rebuild their lives. Migrants Organise would like to express gratitude to its members, trustees, funders, supporters, partner organisations and the wider community for their solidarity and unwavering support throughout this legal process. We are grateful to our legal team Zillur Rahman of Rahman Lowe and Mark Henderson of Doughty Street Chambers. Commenting on the settlement, Mr Rahman said: “We have seen a real increase in the hostility towards migrants and refugees in the last few years under this Government. I am delighted for Migrants Organise, who have been vindicated. They have shown great courage in challenging the false and often dangerous rhetoric around migrants and refugees. I hope this also serves as a lesson to conservative media outlets and their presenters to ensure that they are more responsible in what they say and publish on this topic” .

They have expressed concern it was suggested that they were ‘funded to help illegal migration’, were ‘human traffickers’, and that they facilitated fraud and terrorism by advising asylum seekers to falsify information to bolster their asylum claims. We are happy to clarify that it was not our or Mike’s intention to make those allegations and we accept there wasn’t a factual basis for doing so. There were criticisms of Migrants Organise in the show and we should have offered the charity the opportunity to come on and respond.

Migrants Organise,Updated Resources to Challenge Reporting Conditions,01-Jun-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/updated-guidance-and-flyers-to-challenge-reporting-conditions/,"We’ve published two updated resources to help you challenge immigration reporting conditions! Our guidance for advisers and caseworkers on challenging reporting conditions has now been updated to reflect changes in policy up to May 2023. The guide provides clear, step-by-step questions and tips to help you understand and challenge a reporting condition. We’ve also included template letters you can use. We have also published an updated flyer and checklist on the topic of challenging reporting conditions. These flyers share key information and provide a simple checklist that can be used to help indicate if a reporting condition is not appropriate for someone. They are free to print, distribute and share! If you are involved in a local signing solidarity group, for example, please feel free to take some flyers with you next time you go to your local reporting centre. Reporting conditions are unnecessary and can be extremely burdensome. We hope these resources will be useful in challenging reporting for individual cases and supporting people to know their rights around reporting. You can find both of these resources and many more materials developed by the Migrants Organise team on our publications page. Together, we can abolish reporting! Reporting conditions are a key part of how the hostile environment immigration policy inflicts violence on our communities and makes it difficult for migrants to access basic justice and dignity in daily life. Migrants Organise is part of the Abolish Reporting campaign , a coalition of grassroots groups fighting for a world of care, not surveillance. Led by people with direct experience of the reporting system, we’re calling for this unfair, unjust and unnecessary harassment of migrants to be abolished. Learn more ."
Migrants Organise,ARTICLE: Supporting people with immigration issues in the context of the Mental Health Act 1983 and Mental Capacity Act 2005,12-May-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/article-supporting-people-with-immigration-issues-in-the-context-of-the-mental-health-act-1983-and-mental-capacity-act-2005/,"Migrants Organise is proud to share an article recently published in  “ Medicine, Science and the Law ” which is the official peer reviewed official journal of the British Academy for Forensic Sciences (BAFS). The article is co-written by our Legal Organiser Brian Dikoff  alongside specialist psychiatrists  Cornelius Katona, Piyal Sen, Rukyya Hassan, Rohit Shankar, Lucia Chaplin, Andrew Forrester. The authors are members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists ‘ specialist “Asylum and refugee group”. Read the Article Providing mental health support to migrants and people claiming asylum with uncertain or unresolved immigration status and/or with ‘No Recourse to Public Funds’ (NRPF) can pose a distinct challenge for mental health practitioners within both hospital and community settings. We hope this article will be helpful to a multitude of professions- from Doctors, mental health specialists, lawyers to advocates and more. This article: focuses on the importance of health care professionals and NHS trusts to facilitate and ensure independent immigration advice and support for individuals, given how much of a risk factor unresolved immigration issue is when it comes to mental health. recommends the NHS trusts invest on training and education for staff on hostile environment asylum and immigration issues so that they can better support their patients. This includes helping patients obtain accredited immigration advice, e.g. from legal aid providers and/or OISC charities. provides a broad brush description of the hostile environment, and the various interconnected challenges that migrants and asylum seekers face such as accommodation, surveillance, difficulties in accessing GP / health care, etc., and how they all detrimentally impact someone’s mental health. We also hope that the article can be useful in day to day advocacy with clients and maybe also in a Judicial Review context, in particular: In the context of care and discharge planning, especially under the Mental Health Act 1983, the article makes clear that immigration support should be part of an overarching person-centred approach, and should be done as soon as possible Dispersal issue is addressed specifically , particularly in relation to s117 aftercare duty and how professionals need to think about the impact of dispersal and difficulties in re-establishing support network especially for someone who is mentally vulnerable. Hopefully this can help argue destitution plus points when it comes to National Asylum Support Service (NASS) vs Local Authority (LA) A support. While the article talks mainly in the context of s117, there are many similarities within the context of Care Act . We hope the article can help help establish immigration support as a part of  eligibility outcomes under the Care Act (e.g. under access to services) and/or push LAs to exercise power under s19. This is particularly important when it comes to those with mental capacity issues with immigration decisions who might not have very clear Care Act eligibility. The Migrants Mental Capacity Advocacy (MMCA) Project at Migrants Organise is a strategic project which provides direct, holistic support for migrants and asylum seekers facing issues with their mental capacity in relation to immigration matters.

Migrants Organise,Charities protest Capita AGM over controversial government GPS tracking contract,11-May-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/charities-protest-capita-agm-over-controversial-government-gps-tracking-contract/,"Campaigners appearing today outside Capita PLC’s Annual General Meeting ask shareholders of the outsourcing company to confront the grave human rights implications of Capita’s relationship with the Home Office. Capita PLC holds a £114m contract to help the Home Office track the location of non-British citizens 24/7 using GPS ankle tags and portable fingerprint scanners – a practice shown to cause physical and mental harm. Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), Migrants Organise and Privacy International (PI) have launched a campaign challenging Capita’s Managing Director for Electronic Monitoring to watch and respond to testimonies of people fitted with GPS trackers by Capita. Visit the campaign page Campaigners assembled outside Capita PLC’s Annual General Meeting in the City of London today are contesting the outsourcing company’s £114m contract to deliver 24/7 GPS monitoring services, used by the Home Office to surveil people without British citizenship. Capita shareholders were greeted by a circling mobile billboard van and leaflets informing AGM attendees of the grave human rights and health risks associated with Capita’s GPS tracking contract. Charities Bail for Immigration Detainees, Migrants Organise and Privacy International called for Capita’s Managing Director for Electronic Monitoring to watch and respond to recorded testimonies from people fitted by Capita employees with 24/7 surveillance devices. Capita’s delivery of GPS tracking services allows the Home Office to monitor the location of non-British citizens as part of its hostile environment immigration policy. The Home Office’s own equality impact assessment of the Hostile Environment policy admits that measures may “disproportionately impact people of colour” . People who are tracked are unlikely to be aware of what data is collected, how long it’s stored for, what it’s used for and who it’s shared with. Research has found that the use of GPS tracking causes a number of debilitating and harmful outcomes for individuals including, but not limited, to increasing social isolation and stigma; a detrimental impact upon people’s mental health, in particular leading to anxiety, stress, depression and PTSD; disruptive and undermining impact upon interpersonal and familial relationships, such as the ability to care for children; and physical pain or discomfort with varying levels of severity. The Home Office is currently under investigation by the Information Commissioner (ICO) following a complaint by Privacy International regarding the scheme’s data protection and human rights implications. While Capita’s public statements present the company as a staunch supporter of human rights and anti-racism, campaigners are keen to set the record straight for shareholders and the public. Nasrin Warsame, Policy & Research Co-ordinator at Bail for Immigration Detainees said “Just a few years ago, like many companies, Capita was jumping to espouse values of anti-racism and justice, yet they facilitate racialised surveillance by tracking non-British people – including asylum seekers and people born & raised in the UK. GPS tracking is a punitive and inhumane practice that causes mental and physical harm for the wearer & damages social relationships with family and the community. We urge Capita to take a principled stance and make these harmful policies obsolete.” Mallika Balakrishnan, Digital Organiser at Migrants Organise said “The digital GPS tracking Capita provides to the Home Office is a direct extension of the ‘physical’ hostile environment our members face every day: disproportionate and cruel by design. Instead of lining the pockets of private companies like Capita, the government should be putting resources towards supporting everyone in this country to lead lives in conditions of dignity— not surveillance.” Harmit Kambo, Campaigns Director at Privacy International said “Capita PLC claims to be a purpose-driven business, but what kind of a purpose is subjecting non-British citizens to 24-hour surveillance? It’s punitive, controlling, unnecessary, and has severe human rights implications – the government is already under investigation and facing various legal claims. Companies should not be blindly profiting from such hostile policies. Last year we saw charter airlines refusing to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda – we call on Capita and its shareholders to follow suit and prioritise the dignity of vulnerable people over profit.” Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID) is an independent charity that exists to end immigration detention in the UK. BID aims to end immigration detention in the UK through the provision of legal advice, information and representation alongside research, policy advocacy and strategic litigation. Migrants Organise is an award-winning, grassroots platform where migrants connect, build common ground, and organise for dignity and justice for all. Migrants Organise is part of the Abolish Reporting campaign, which demands an end to immigration surveillance.

Migrants Organise,Yorkshire Solidarity Summit,18-Apr-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/yorkshire-solidarity-summit/,"‘The world we want” Solidarity Knows No Borders Yorkshire.  Watch the short film. Solidarity Knows No Borders Yorkshire On Saturday 15th April 2023, Migrants Organise with over 120 migrant justice community campaigners and allies co-organised the Solidarity Knows No Borders Yorkshire Summit in Sheffield. The Solidarity Summit was a commitment to working together at the grassroots to build resilience in our communities as well as a shared commitment to imagine better futures for all. Our Organiser Sarli Nana shares more: “In the wake of the pandemic and in the midst of this government’s escalation of anti-migrant politics and policies, communities across Yorkshire have been growing their power and building networks of solidarity for migrant justice. During the pandemic we had to find creative ways of building our resilience over Zoom. As hostile anti-migrant policies grew we took actions of solidarity across our communities. From standing up for our friends like Simba who was charged over 100,000 for receiving life saving healthcare treatment to fighting back against the Rwanda deportation plans and the cruelty of the 2022 Nationality and Borders Act . It has been essential to grow local communities of solidarity. The Yorkshire Solidarity Summit, held in Sheffield, was an exciting day because it brought together over 120 people from 60 groups and organisations involved in 55 campaigns. Sarli Nana In the room were people who are at the heart of this work, including groups and organisations like City of Sanctuary Sheffield , South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), These Walls Must Fall , Voice for the Voiceless (VVDY), Humber All Nations Alliance (HANA) as well unions like , University and College (UCU), Acorn Sheffield and Industrial Workers of the World , academics and individual allies. We were also  joined by friends from Solidarity Knows No Borders community from Manchester, Liverpool and London. Collectively our work ranges from building power to have better access to healthcare, the right to work as well as demanding an end to immigration detention, surveillance, raids and deportations. Our struggles are connected Walking up from Victoria Docks to the venue with colleagues who came all the way from Hull, we were excited to come to the Summit to discuss plans to tackle the hostile environment like the proposed anti-refugee immigration bill, immigration raids, detentions and deportations. The challenges of working in the migrant justice sector makes travelling to events more challenging, as people are often under-resourced and face capacity issues to join in organising at the regional or national level. When we opened the doors at 10am people were already queuing for the Summit – a first sign of success! People came from half a dozen towns and cities from across Yorkshire. They were also from different types of groups and organisations ranging from campaigning groups to registered charities, trade unions and two universities. We kicked off with our organising round of introductions. We didn’t have time for detailed rounds given that we have over 100 participants but it was powerful to recognise everyone in the room.  What came out of the enthusiastic intros was the diversity of participants and groups/organisations present. Sounds of solidarity There is no dull moment in Yorkshire! In solidarity with all oppressed people around the world, Amir Monsef a Sanctuary seeker from Iran, performed a song he dedicated to the women and people of Iran. The speakers were drawn from the migrant justice frontlines. Zrinka Bralo the CEO of Migrants Organise set the scene with an inspiring speech reminding the audience that our struggle is a long distance relay not a sprint. She has  seen off 14 Home Secretaries and six Prime Ministers, so is not new to the hostile environment. Zrinka invited the Yorkshire Summit to build alliances to fight against the oppressive immigration laws, now penetrating all our public services. Mary Brandon, Regional Campaigns Manager, Asylum Matters , highlighted some of the campaigns and initiatives that are ongoing in the region. She pointed out that bringing in people who are not usually part of our ‘sector’ is one of the ways to achieve changes. She cited Penistone Council and the private sector involvement in the Lift the Ban Campaign (a campaign to give people claiming asylum the right to work) as examples of how the public and private sector has pledged to defend the right to asylum. Then we had the amazing trio from Solidarity Knows No Borders Merseyside : Nina Houghton, Celine Hay and Manono Kawoza. They talked about their own experiences in organising for justice. In addition to going to demos, they have started the difficult job of knocking on doors and trying to raise awareness about migrants rights and their situation to residents of some areas. Action Planning The participants broke into six workshops to discuss the major issues facing people in the region including; the hostile environment, learnings from ‘Justice for Simba Campaign’ on NHS charging, ‘Tell it as a migrant’ focused on  sharing our stories, Mutual aid, Migrant Women Rights and Migrant Workers Rights. The summary of the discussions will be used as part of the action planning for Solidarity Knows No Borders Yorkshire future organising. The Summit was a space for people to meet and connect  and showcase their work and campaign on 16 information stalls all within the hall. The lunch, cooked and donated by our allies in the Jubilee Movement, was delicious. Next Steps The participants who registered are already involved in over 50 campaigns and part of about 60 groups/organisations. The next step is to deepen these solidarity connections in Yorkshire and add more people to the Yorkshire Solidarity Knows No Borders Organising Group. First we have a few simple steps to take:  from setting up our mailing list, action planning and organising and learning together (starting with media training.) To connect, organise, grow our power, speak out and take action for dignity and justice in Yorkshire please reach out Sarli Nana sarli@migrantsorganise.org For more information about Solidarity Knows No Borders and the movement for migrant justice please visit: https://firmcharter.org.uk"
Migrants Organise,The ‘Refugee Ban Bill’ harms us all,27-Mar-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/the-refugee-ban-bill-harms-us-all/,"We believe that there is a brighter, safer future for all of us beyond the current “hostile by design” border system.  However, the latest “Illegal Migration Bill ” currently fast tracked through the Parliament is designed to punish the very people who need our protection. It will harm all our communities and offer us no solutions to a growing crisis of humanity. The Bill – which has aptly been renamed as the “Refugee Ban Bill” –  will effectively  end the right to claim asylum in the UK. This will be based on how people arrive.  If they arrive through irregular routes, including boats, their right to protection will be denied. However, there are simply no other routes for people to take. This Bill, by the admission of the Home Secretary,  is likely to be in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights and 1951 Refugee Convention. The Bill has been condemned across society – charities, faith leaders, local councils and even footballers have spoken out in opposition- and comes just a year after the oppressive “Nationality and Borders Act 2022” which significantly eroded the rights of migrants and refugees and paved the way for the horrific Rwanda Deportation Plan. https://twitter.com/migrantsorg/status/1635363180867383296?s=20 How many and who will this impact? The Refugee Council estimates that in the first three years of this Bill coming into effect, over 250,000 people will be denied the right to have their asylum claim heard. This will leave an estimated 190,000 people languishing in immigration detention centres, including 45,000 children who could be locked up. It’s clear that this Bill is designed to prolong the trauma that people have moved to escape. It will do nothing to offer the safe routes people deserve, and is likely to exacerbate tensions across many communities where far right groups are active. Migrants Organise CEO, Zrinka Bralo says: “The government is only focused on enforcement and hostility and is unwilling to consider humane and legal solutions  – to implement our obligation under the 1951 Geneva Convention, which was created to provide protection. I am alive today because I was given protection fleeing from the war in my country thirty years ago. If I needed that protection today, I would not survive. The negative rhetoric of ‘invasion’ and criminalisation of people in need of protection is divisive and dangerous, as we have seen in recent far-right attacks on places where refugees are forced to stay. The government is giving France half a billion pounds to build another prison for refugees instead of using that money to resolve hundreds of thousands of asylum claims of people whose lives have been on hold for years because of it.  All refugees could be welcomed equally and allowed to rebuild their lives, and the British public has shown that they are ready and willing to welcome them. “ Politicians continue to weaponise migrants and refugees to distract from other crises, and in turn normalise divisive, extreme and oppressive policies which crack down on the fundamental rights and dignity we all deserve. The expansion of the ‘hostile environment immigration policy’ has been profitable for many private companies benefiting from enforcement contracts and the exploitation of vulnerable people with no voice or legal representation. This goes hand in hand with dehumanisation – using phrases such as ‘stop the boats’ takes the emphasis away from the people. It is the very people who need protection that will be stopped. Solidarity We will not look the other way while our communities are harmed. By building communities of care and solidarity, we are growing our power to protect each other. Together we can and will achieve a better future, one that is based on the values of dignity, justice and welcome. Migrants Organise is a platform for migrants and refugees to organise for justice.

J oin us at our next New Joiners meeting on April 18th. No Borders in the NHS Bloc at the SOS NHS demonstration On Saturday 11 March , we joined the SOS NHS national demonstration, to march to defend the NHS. Through the #PatientsNotPassports campaign, we organised the “No Borders in the NHS” bloc, to show our support for all striking health workers, to demand that the government ends the crisis in the NHS, and that they end all hostile environment immigration controls in healthcare and beyond. Tens of thousands of us took to the streets, marching to defend the NHS ⁠— from privatisation, underfunding, gross undervaluing of workers, and insidious and exclusionary immigration controls. Get involved with the Patients Not Passports campaign! We must stand united against a Government that seeks to divide us. Whether they say migrants are to blame for our struggling public services, that nurses are asking for too much pay, or that private services are needed to save money—we know that this is based on lies. In reality, the Government is deliberately underfunding the NHS, while telling health workers to work harder for less pay. Hostile environment immigration policies are excluding migrants from the vital services they need to live, including charging migrants up-front up to 150% of the cost for their healthcare, and turning health workers against their patients. This paves the way for NHS privatisation and for a health system that prioritises private profit over our collective well-being. That is why we joined tens of thousands of others on the streets to defend the NHS from the forces that seek to destroy it. You can see more coverage of the demonstration here . Aliya , from Migrants Organise, and Isis , a medical student, involved in the Patients Not Passports campaign, spoke from the platform at the demonstration, to connect our struggles for migrant justice with the fight to defend and protect the NHS.

Speak Out! series has been organised by members of the Solidarity Knows No Borders communitys political education working group (including Migrants Organise, Social Workers Without Borders, and Positive Action For Refugees & Asylum Seekers) which seeks to raise awareness of the hostile environment in the public sector. What is this series about? Social workers, GPs, local authority officers, and others often play a crucial role in the community to safeguard migrants and asylum seekers, but many of them are unaware of Hostile Environment or how to resist it day to day. Throughout the series there will be a wide range of topics designed to support people within work places to understand the current immigration system and its impact on our communities. Topics will include: safeguarding, family reunion, No Recourse to Public Funds, NHS Charging, legal aid, and more, as well as sessions one the role of colonialism in our current immigration system and ways we can organise for power. The sessions will be lead by migrant justice organisers, campaigners from organisations in our community, caseworkers and academics, all sharing insight on how we can resist the hostile environment together. The sessions are open to anyone who wants to learn more about supporting people who have moved to this country to make a better life. Please browse and share the full series programme here!"
Migrants Organise,“We have rights. And we need to know them.” Lola speaks out,27-Feb-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/we-have-rights-and-we-need-to-know-them/,"Migrants Organise member, Lola speaks out about living life under the brutal eye of the Home Office and the everyday strategies of resistance that helped her to grow her  power. Lola’s story “The day they [immigration enforcement officers]  banged on the door, it was the day my daughter clocked three. The day of her birthday. I was upstairs trying to get my daughter to sleep, reading a bedtime story in my sisters house. Illustration by Esme Hemmings Studio It was twenty minutes past eight. BANG. It was so loud. My sister and her husband were downstairs. My sister’s husband opened the door. Four Immigration Officers came in. We realised it was me they wanted to speak to. It was terrifying- I’d only seen this sort of thing on TV. I think because of my daughter they didn’t take me anywhere- like a detention centre.  But, they did say  I had to start reporting. On this day, my depression started. No control Before this day I’d finished studying my Masters in Business Administration. The situation had changed a lot back home- I really couldn’t go back. I had my daughter with me, so I tried to apply for papers. I was living with my sister. She was a nurse. I couldn’t work. I was at home taking care of my daughter and my sister’s two kids. It wasn’t easy. My sister made food available, but if I wanted anything for myself, I couldn’t buy it. I couldn’t buy anything for my daughter…only my sister could. I had no money, no nothing. I was hoping for better. I had no control over my life. You can’t say what’s going to happen. Reporting I had to start “reporting” at the immigration centre. I travelled to Croydon every two weeks for four years. It’s written in the letter that you might be detained, so anytime you are going you think “this might be the end”. I would always tell my sister when I was about to report- I’d call her to let her know “I’m about to enter” maybe ten minutes later when I’m done I call her “I’m done”. That’s how scared you are. Sometimes I’d see people being told to sit down and a few minutes later you’d see an immigration officer come and take them away…maybe to  a detention centre …and from there some of them may be deported. You wouldn’t know where they’d gone. It could be me next. When you go in, they look at you like you’re worthless…it’s dehumanising. Anything could happen at any time. Read more about our campaign to Abolish Reporting So I’d always be going on the basis of “this might be it”. This might be the end. Knowing my rights “Say nothing, ask no questions. Whatever they say, you have to just do” That’s what I used to think. I used to think they could just say ““right you’re going back to your country”. But I realised that even without our immigration status- we still have rights. Like, if we have a health emergency we have the right to get free healthcare. And, when we are reporting we have the right to speak. In the reporting centre, they used to tell me where to sit- but then I started deciding where to sit. I learnt this at the Women’s Group as Migrants Organise. A lawyer came to speak with the group and we learnt this. Everyone needs to know their rights. Join the Migrants Organise Newsletter I remember the first day I went to Migrants Organise. I spoke to Heike, she’s the Advice Manager. I explained everything to her, she listened and said they would support me. In the end, she gave me money for my travel costs. My mouth dropped- nobody had done this before.  That there could be people here,  that can take me as a family. At Migrants Organise I had the right to dignity. They took my problem as one big problem- here, any problem I have is like everyone’s problem. Back in 2020, in the beginning of the pandemic, I had to move out of home suddenly. I was close to being homeless with my daughter. I rang Migrants Organise: Heike, Brian, Francesca, Bethan. They got back to me- they found somewhere for me. We now have leave to remain. This has been a huge relief. I have my rights, my daughter has rights. I have more rights now. I’m working. My daughter is at school. I’m a carer. I’m a people person you see- people say I have a warm energy. I think it’s true. Next, I’m going to train as a nurse. Migrants Organise stood by us- they got me  something called “exceptional case funding” and helped me find a solicitor  to regularise our status. They do more than what a family does. They made sure everything was available for us and really tried for us. My wish There’s a lot we can change about this system. Firstly, let people work.  Not being able to work frustrates us, when we dependant on other people to lie, it’s so horrible. It drains people mentally, there is a lot of depression. When you rely on other people “what’s going to happen next…I don’t know” it stops us from expanding our wings. Then we can pay tax, we contribute to the economy and we become independent. Secondly,  let us know our rights. And number three: Equality!  We are still humans. We are not worthless. When you don’t have your immigration status – people look at you like you are nobody. It’s dehumanising. But the truth is: we are still worth something. We are still here. Let people know.” Building Power is key to our work at Migrants Organise . To do this we organise and campaign, and also organise support services. The Migrants Organise Community Programme works with around 550 migrants and refugees and their families every year.  We provide a combination of advice, advocacy, training, mentoring , and group activities  that create a safe and welcoming environment for our community members.

Migrants Organise,A victory for our Housing Group…,09-Feb-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/a-victory-for-our-housing-group/,"When our friend Aamir was forced into living in a house with rodents, mould and no hot water, our members rallied around him.  Brick by brick we are coming together to organise for better living conditions for our communities, and we won’t stop until here… Rodents, Mould, Broken – this house is falling apart The conditions in *Aamir’s (name changed) East London asylum accommodation was so bad that it was making him physically sick, anxious and unable to sleep. It was infested with rodents, had no hot water, rife with mould, overcrowded, no working shower,  electricity and gas was always turning off as the metre was not kept topped up by the managing agents- making it very difficult to cook warm meals. The electricity issues rendered kitchen appliances—including the refrigerator—dysfunctional. And the entire unit smelled of spoiled food due to old leaks on the carpeting, which was never cleaned or replaced despite residents’ multiple requests for maintenance. Aamir was struggling and getting nowhere with his complaints to the managing agents, Clearsprings Ready Homes Ltd. Clearsprings Ready Homes , the managing organisation for Aamir’s accommodation, is one of the companies contracted by the Home Office to provide suitable accommodation for asylum seekers. They promise to deliver “ safe, secure and warm [asylum] accommodation” and are contracted to do so until 2029. But the reality of living everyday in Aamir’s accommodation was anything but “safe, secure”. When members of Migrants Organise heard about Aamir’s situation they wanted to do something. Migrants Organise Housing Group Aamir’s story is sadly too familiar for Migrants Organise. Every year we work with over 500 individuals and their families – many of them are living in asylum accommodation. “ When we come together, we can change things” Migrants Organise Housing Group Our members, the majority of whom are trapped within the asylum system- formed the “Housing Organising Group” just a few months ago. The reality of living inside asylum accommodation is causing distress and fear. Whether this accommodation is ‘dispersal accommodation’ (often a house in multiple accommodation or ‘HMO’ ) like Aamir’s accommodation, or within hotels the reality is that people are in challenging conditions with no control over their lives. In ‘hotels’, people are confined to one small room for months on end, without access to kitchen or cleaning facilities, no communal space, substandard food.  The stark reality is: these places aren’t everyday hotels, they are ‘detention hotels’. Our members, live everyday trapped within “detention hotels’ unable to move on with their lives. People living stuck in this system face constant uncertainty and anxiety. Whether you are in a hotel or ‘HMO’, the threat of not knowing when and if you will be told to pack your things and move across the country with a moment’s notice is debilitating. The English language course you enrolled in? Forget about it. The playgroup your child has made friends at? No matter. The GP you spent weeks trying to register at? Who cares? The football group that helped you feel less isolated? Not essential. Pack up your bags and wait outside, your taxi will be outside in a few hours.  Destination? Unknown. Enough is Enough The Group decided to come together, to build power and fight back. They meet fortnightly to share experiences and survival strategies. When some of the group met Aamir and after hearing his story they were restless. Taking action with Aamir Members of the group visited Aamir’s accommodation to listen to Aamir and the five other residents. They collected photos and wrote testimony through organised meetings with residents and neighbours. After considering different options they decided to submit a collective written complaint to Clearsprings Ready Homes.  The letter, from the residents, included a detailed list of just how bad things were- highlighting the rodents, mould and no heating or hot water. The letter was submitted via Migrant Help – the organisation sub-contracted to deal with complaints. It was clear that Clearsprings Ready Homes were breaching environmental health. The residents made clear demands that they wanted to see implemented within a month. These demands included: pest control, working hot water/heating, working shower, the deep cleaning of the carpet to remove the terrible odour from rotten food contamination, and to have clear and accountable channels of communication with the housing managers. The situation was so bad that it was covered by local newspaper the East London Advertiser who spoke to Aamir’s friend, Mohammed (*not real name), who also lives at the property. Mohammed told the reporter “the whole house is falling apart”. Finally, after months of ignoring and inaction, Clearsprings were forced to listen. Today, nearly all of these repairs have been made to the property resulting in a real material improvement to residents’ lives. In a letter to the Group, Clearsrpings wrote: “ Clearsprings Ready Homes provides safe, warm, secure accommodation for our Service Users; all asylum seekers are able to access the Migrants Help service for registering complaints or request assistance 24/7. We take any complaints or issues raised by our service users and all reported concerns are investigated and actioned appropriately . “ How Clearsprings Profit from the Hostile Environment Despite’s Clearsprings’ statement, our experience tells us that Aamir’s situation is far from unique.  Horrific cases have also been recorded in national newspapers like this case in Hillingdon “ Housing Provider to make urgent repairs to asylum seeker flats ” in the Guardian (2022) and “ Animals don’t get treated like this : How asylum housing problems have been exacerbated by the pandemic ” in the Independent (2020). Illustration by Lewisham Anti-Raids Despite this ongoing media and public alarm over unsafe, unhygienic conditions in the properties they run, the Home Office has awarded Clearsprings £996 million in contracts for their provision of “safe, secure and warm” asylum accommodation until 2029. Perhaps, Clearsprings is most famous for being the company running the makeshift detention centres at Penally and Napier Barracks. At Napier, the conditions were so bad in 2021 that 350 residents reported to have gone on hunger strike . Not only was the site itself unfit for purpose, but the people who were being forced to live there were referred to only as “numbers” (not their real names), in a dehumanising project situated within the hostile environment’s racist and anti-migrant agenda. Whilst Penally Barracks has shut down, Napier Barracks – which has been labelled “unfit for accommodation ” (The Guardian, 2021) and “unlawful” (BBC, 2021)- remains open. It’s clear that Clearsprings’ business model is growing and profiting from the pain of migrants and refugees. It was reported in the Guardian that in 2022 Clearsprings recorded a “bumper profit- with their profit margins increasing sixfold to with dividends jumping from £7m to £27,987,262 a year”. The same article points out that almost 28 million of dividends is shared by its three directors. A quick look at this shocking Corporate Watch file ( ‘Clearsprings Migrant Camp profiteers ’) shows that the Home Office’s outsourcing of asylum accommodation to private firms like Clearsprings begets minimal accountability—and maximal profit. We demand change . It’s time to put people over profit. The Migrants Organise Housing Group is coming together to demand a change. Reflecting on the success of the actions the group took with Aamir, Nanou from the group said: “This shows that when we organise together, we can build the world we want to live in, brick by brick: a world where we have dignity and justice. But our friends in Tower Hamlets should not have to fight for the bare minimum. We will keep fighting to end this deliberate outsourcing of accountability that keeps us in miserable, inhumane conditions for years on end.” If you would like more information about the Housing Group or want to get involved please contact Maymuna@migrantsorganise.org Migrants Organise is a platform for migrants and refugees to organise for justice.

Migrants Organise,Migrants Organise Members Speak Out…,30-Jan-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/migrants-organise-members-speak-out/,"When we show up for each other, to support each other, we are powerful. Solidarity is everything. This is one of our core beliefs at Migrants Organise. A few weeks ago three of our members, Saydul, Bose and Ruth came together to share what solidarity means to them and how anything is possible when we come together. Watch the film below, and read on to hear from members. Saydul “Before, I didn’t know about ‘solidarity’ or something like this, but when I joined this organisation, then I started to believe in humanity again.” They arranged* a nice accommodation for me [*through a hosting network] When I wake up, I’m in this house, sometimes for me it’s unbelievable. Because I know what a house means. I know what family means. I don’t have anyone here. No close relatives or family here. But today I have friends, I have a group. So, for me, it’s more than my family. When people come together, we can fight for anything.” Ruth “The thing that Migrants Organise gave me was to be able to express myself, in a way that I never thought that I’d be able to do. “ I’m part of the poetry group, arts group, and the women’s group. Every Tuesday I would be looking forward to the group because then I could see the ladies, we could have a talk, and then I didn’t feel that isolated. Solidarity means working together to achieve a common goal. Justice, freedom and equality.” Bose “Solidarity is giving a sense of family, a sense of belonging.” “What really stood out for me, joining Migrants Organise, was when I got my admission to the college. It gave me an opportunity to study again, to do what I love – I love maths. And I’m preparing for my GCSE. Solidarity is giving a sense of family, a sense of belonging. Getting strength from one another. You partake in all these activities and it gives you more strength, it gives you more hope.” Migrants Organise is a platform for migrants and refugees to organise for justice.

Migrants Organise,Hackney Patients Not Passports Screening: NHS Borderlands at Homerton Hospital – 16th Feb 2023,25-Jan-23,https://www.migrantsorganise.org/hackney-patients-not-passports-screening-nhs-borderlands-at-homerton-hospital-16th-feb-2023/,"Hackney Patients Not Passports presents a screening of NHS Borderlands at Homerton Hospital on Thursday February 16 th 2023. This is a guest blog written by Rayah Feldman, a campaigner with Hackney Patients Not Passports Hackney Patients Not Passports (PNP) is delighted to have the opportunity to show the short film NHS Borderlands to staff at Homerton Hospital. Register for the event on Eventbrite here ! NHS Borderlands is an investigative documentary exploring the human impact of NHS charges on migrants. The short film explores the story of Angela, who fled persecution in Zimbabwe only to be subjected to Hostile Environment immigration policies in the UK and charged £8,000 for vital medical care. But Angela, like many others, is not allowed to work or claim benefits, and is among the poorest people in our society. Angela’s story exposes the reality for thousands of people living in the UK who face charges for and exclusion from vital medical care, undermining the NHS’s founding commitment to universal healthcare. Hackney PNP is part of the national Patients Not Passports network which seeks to raise awareness of NHS charging and its impact on migrants. Many health workers are unaware that the government’s ‘Hostile Environment’ policies against migrants also affect their patients. Although the NHS is the most loved British public service, with its principle of treatment based on need, not ability to pay, it is now a major target of the Hostile Environment. People on visitor visas and those with irregular immigration status are now required to pay huge sums for hospital care. For example, standard maternity care, for example costs over £7000. Unless exempt, patients may be refused treatment if they cannot pay in advance. After the film there will be a discussion and Q&A with members of Patients Not Passports in Hackney and from elsewhere. We’ll also provide information on where you can signpost patients who need to get advice if they’ve been charged, and provide information for healthcare workers, including what aspects of healthcare are not subject to charging. All are welcome! To book your place, please register on Eventbrite here . For more information, contact info@patientsnotpassports.co.uk . ."
